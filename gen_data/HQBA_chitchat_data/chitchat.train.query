hey, what's the matter, son?
hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?
would you have to do extra work?
and is this martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?
so, let the baby have his bottle, huh? that's my motto.
bart! come over here.
you little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.
that thing you know how to do.
about last night... you might have noticed daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
i admit it. i didn't know when to say when. i'm sorry it happened and i just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
marriage encounter weekend, here i come!
oh dear. if we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. what a kick in the teeth.
hi, honey. uh, oh. how's the marriage retreat going?
i was just kidding, marge. hey, what does everyone say to dinner at krusty burger? my treat!
all right, what are you getting at?
a hundred bucks?! for a comic book? who drew it, micha-ma-langelo?
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no! now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, i give in, so i'm not mad at you for trying. it shows you've been paying attention. but we all know i'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. now are you gonna stop bugging me?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
bart! what are you staring at?
bart! stop it!
what's the problem, boy?
hey, when i was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
nah.
woo! yes! all right! woo! congratulations, boy! you've got a date with a needle!
bart, it's not like i'm asking you to give blood for free. that would be crazy! you're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. don't you know the story of hercules and the lion?
yeah, probably. anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. and all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. so they got hercules, and hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave hercules this big thing of riches.
it was the olden days!
marge, you're my wife and i love you very much. but you're living in a world of make-believe. with flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...
"dear mr. burns. i'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your caard was just great. in case you can't tell, i'm being sarcastic. you stink!" could you read that last part back to me?
good. "you are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."
bart, have you seen the letter?
all right, think very carefully. where did you see it last?
uh huh.
yeah...
why did you do that?
ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
what does it look like? i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.
now bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. just give me some kind of signal.
that's a good one. we'll use that.
what did i tell you? i'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...
save a guy's life, and whattaya get? nothin'! worse than nothin'! just a big, scary rock.
lisa, you like homework. could you fill out this form for me?
no deal.
son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me. remember that absentee ballot?
dog on fire! dog on fire!
yes, i'm hearing one right now, while i'm trying to watch tv.
bart! shut up or i'll shut you up!
arrghh!
that's all right, son.
#name?
here he is! here's the guy you wanna see.
shoe goes on, shoe goes off. shoe goes on, shoe goes off. shoe goes on, shoe goes off.
stupid welcoming mint! y'ello.
wake-up call? it's two am!
bart, are you ready to go to... i'll room service you...
hey, no tagbacks.
yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.
ooh, the touch of death.
hey, boy. how was class?
hey, bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?
hey, look what i got. a genuine official police badge... calling all cars... come out with your hands up!
how much does it pay?
pfft. i make more than that.
... bart! have you started smoking?
aha! cigarettes, just as i thought.
wait till i get you home, boy.
hey, this is the only paper in america that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.
what's your problem, boy?
mel brooks is jewish?
boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
get a good haul this year?
i am very, very proud of you kids.
hiya bart!!! how's my boy! heh heh. heh heh.
come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.
good night, son.
well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.
oh, ah, thanks boy.
how hard can it be?
ooo, what job is that?
no. bart bit me.
sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
because she stopped loving me.
marge, could we go in the other room? i did something last night i'm not proud of and i don't want the kids to hear it.
i'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then i have ten minutes to spend as i please. then i'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.
coming right up, sir.
oooooh! that's one clean tombstone.
in the garage.
if stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
bart!... bart!!!
you don't have any hobbies, do you boy?
well, that's what i... wait a minute. what are you doing?
oh, that's a hobby!
bart!... i'm gonna help you build that racer.
okay. no, i'm gonna do it.
what was that? ah, who cares. son, please let me help you.
all right, i will! son, i don't think you should let me help you.
loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!
are you nervous son?
okay bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. so, i'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...
bart, the car had a few bugs in it, i admit that. but we're team simpson.
when did i ever teach you that?
i'm not pouting, you are.
that's my boy. nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!
bart, why are you still up?
say your name? why should i do that, my lad?
take that off this second!
ow!
there.
maybe.
yeah, but i have to hear about it.
hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!
oh, c'mon, honey. you know how it turns out. after all, you wouldn't be here today if i hadn't become the responsible head of a household.
bart, i'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. well, check out my present!
hey boy, how's the microphone working?
bart! i would love to get a present like that.
mmmmm. chocolate.
wait a minute. does this mean you like my present?
just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
don't worry, son. just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. i brought you your krusty doll...
hey, don't make me come down there!
shh! marge, he's a good digger.
"maybe it's the beer talking, marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. they got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? get outta here."
come here boy, i want to show you something.
and here it is.
marge, forget it. he's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than i do.
well now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's a crock. no matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you.
no, no, no! i don't want you to see me sitting on my butt.
so what're you gonna be, boy?
good for you. maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
correction. three hundred and eighty million to fifty. so what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?
what do kids know about spending money?
well... i guess we'll have to talk it over.
in doggie heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! and all the best dogs are there. old yeller... and about eight lassies and...
well... of course. there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
yeah. and one of the lassies is in there too. the mean one. the one that mauled timmy.
bart! close the gate.
or... to put it another way... there is.
uh... i gotta go.
look maggie, they have a baby, too.
ooooh.
come again?
now, just meet me back here after the show.
this is real.
hey, i thought i was supposed to encourage him.
forget it. that line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
yes, but doesn't the bible also say, "thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut"?
that's better. hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?
son, come here. heh, heh, heh. of course i'm not mad. if something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. you just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch tv.
ooh...a sextet of ale.
oh, my couch! the arms, the seat... the dream is over. all right, who did this?
they do good work.
wake up, boy.
well it is.
now listen, boy. we have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. i don't think i'd be any kind of a father if you got d's and i let you go to kamp krusty.
stupid roller-skate.
a+? you don't think much of me, do you boy?
you know a d turns into a b so easily. you just got greedy.
now, bart. we made this deal because i thought it would help you get good grades. and you didn't. but why should you pay for my mistake?
yeah. i didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
thanks son. now, you've got little hands. can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?
i don't see your name on it, boy.
check... mate.
kids, back me up.
kids, wait in the car. i want to talk to your mother about this play thing.
hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every sunday? i mean, isn't god everywhere?
and don't you think that the almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
and what if we picked the wrong religion? every week we're just making god madder and madder.
that's right, old friend.
but i think she'll win.
boy, when lisa comes in, i want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.
no, she won't. when it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, more! more! and if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return.
is that lisa? ooh, i gotta call heaven -- there's an angel missing!
hey... hey!
happy birthday, son!
that doll tried to kill me!
... so then, his wife comes through the door!!!
well, she was. and she hit him in the head with a golf club!
did you wreck the car?
i did. i did read to her!
just promise me you'll try to be good.
thataboy.
bart, did you take out the garbage like i asked?
boy, you're going to have to be punished for this.
bart! why are you doing that?
well, this time you must be punished.
now, what were we talking about, boy?
all right. all right. bart, go to your room.
bart, didn't i ask you to watch maggie?
all right, boy. this calls for the biggest punishment i've ever handed down. and this time it's gonna stick!
someday you'll thank me for this, son.
no, it's true. you know, when i was a boy i really wanted a catcher's mitt. but, my dad wouldn't get it for me. so i held my breath until i passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. the doctor thought i might have brain damage.
i like stories.
i know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but i can't go back on it. you're welcome to watch anything you want on tv.
all right. i think you've learned your lesson.
which one's the mouse?
itchy's a jerk.
...all you can eat, ha!
no "all you can eat seafood." i wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. nothing!
all right. hit the change of venue button. now!
maybe you're right. now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.
so i says, "yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause i don't know where it is you baloney..." you make me wanna retch...
come on, marge, let the people see your pretty face.
almost time for our commercial.
stop!
absolutely! my prices are so low, you'll think i've suffered brain damage.
when the working day is done / girls just wanna have fu-un / that's all we really wannnnt...
homer is what grown ups call me. call me daddy.
daddy.
daddy.
ye-esss...
heh, heh. got your nose.
nooo! bart, don't you ever do that again. understand?
marge that's...
wait a minute. that was a "lucy" show... okay, where were we?
ah yes. i remember the day we moved in...
bart, i told you not to use that word. call me "daddy."
hi, flanders.
goodnight, honey.
boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.
just workin' the turkey through. there it goes!
trust me.
no, but the rabbi gave me this.
uh, yeah.
kids. kids... i'm not gonna die. that only happens to bad people.
i know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man.
hmmm, false... no, wait. maybe it's true.
heh-heh. kids.
do you want to change your name to homer junior? the kids can call you hoju!
stick your head out the window, boy. it's the greatest!
are we gonna die, son?
donuts. is there anything they can't do?
ding-dong, the witch is dead.
don't hassle the dead, boy. they have eerie powers.
but i love solids.
hey, boy! where you going?
hello, son. where have you been?
no, you haven't! you've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! haven't you, haven't you. look at me.
how would you like me to take it? "go ahead, bart, have your fun, i'll be waiting for you?" i'm sorry, i can't do it.
son, i just want you to know i love you very much.
what's the matter?
i gave it to pepi.
he's my little brother. that's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
come on, bart. we had our fun. remember when i used to push you on the swing?
liar!
this is even more painful than it looks.
yeah?
and then when he's lying on the ground...
kick him in the ribs...
i'd sell my first-born son.
where's your science fair project, boy?
well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, mr. burns or me.
haw, haw. april fool's! i've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! sucker!
you talk better than you fool.
ah, beer. my one weakness. my achilles heel, if you will.
mmmm... beer.
arrrgh!
ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god.
okay, okay. this time i'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him.
the burgers are getting cold, guys. holy moly.
oof.
they're fine.
ah! ooh! arg! son of a -- ! ah! and that's how we shave.
gotcha! it's april fool's for two more minutes!
marge, it happened again!
bart, lisa i have something to tell you, and i'm not proud of it.
mmmm, beer... what?
oh my juice loosener's never gonna come.
now kids, while your mother's gone, i don't wanna have to wash any dishes. so, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet.
yeah.
i'm surprised you don't remember, son. it was only eight years ago.
bart, what did i tell you?
what'd you kids get?
they took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. but if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. bart!
i'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.
this isn't just because of sideshow bob. it's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.
everything is a source of fun...
aaah...
c'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot.
ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies.
so you want me to go to college?
... it was the most i ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
thanks boy. now, for the crowning touch...
woo hoo! a flyer for a hardware store!
we played dungeons and dragons for three hours. then i was slain by an elf.
i got it! we wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
those bastards...
now i'm not saying mr. burns is incontinent...
they're dogs! and they're playing poker!
i can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
oh lisa, haven't you seen "home alone?" if some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.
you kids do need a baby-sitter.
tram...ample...een! tram...baple...een!
hi, son. hi, son. hi, son.
rust i tell ya.
uh-huh.
i just thought i'd remind everybody. after all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.
oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.
stupid poetic justice...!
oh pardon me, mr. let's ration everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? don't you know the poem? "water, water everywhere/ so let's all have a drink."
woo-hoo! see that, boy? your old man was right, not flanders. we are doomed! in your face, flanders!
son, there's something i was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, i want you to have it now.
thanks boy. now be careful when you...
the foul stench of death is upon us. mmmm... hamburgers.
uhhh.
lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.
woo hoo!
shhh, quiet lisa.
bart, give me that megaphone of yours.
asleep at the switch! i wasn't asleep! i was drunk!
yeah, you kids gotta go to school. i gotta go to work. the only one who has it easy is marge.
oh, nothing.
that's not a job. it's a waste of time. what can poor people pay ya? nothin'! what satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? none! who wants to help poor people anyway? nobody!
yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man.
it's okay, son. who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? you're doing what you want to do with your life. nothing else matters.
what the hell are you readin' books for?
don't forget to say "i didn't do it".
how do you figure boy?
that's even worse than the album grampa released.
stupid carbon rod. it's all just a popularity contest.
make it stop!
less shame?
see because of me, now they have a warning.
why am i such a loser? why?
love, marge. don't hate. love.
the flanderses are not geeks! okay, rod and todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. but we've got to give this thing a chance. i want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.
food fight!
hi, mom.
i'd love to honey, but daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today.
son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. it's how drunk you get.
y'ello.
y'ello?
wee!
heh, heh, it does look like al gore.
marge, i agree with you, in theory. in theory communism works. in theory.
oh. good luck. look at these bills. "chain for elephant," "shots for elephant"... "oversized decorative poncho".
well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
wait a minute, this gives me an idea.
this town is full of deadbeats. we can't afford this elephant.
son, you're okay! and you've led us to the precious ivory. and of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to...
i'd like it fine.
oh, i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life. and, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
that's it, boy. you're our last hope.
okay, boy, i wrote down exactly what to say. just read it and you're a shoo-in.
oooh. he card reads good.
oh, yeah. so good...
that was the end piece. that's it! being abusive to your family is one thing but i will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. go to your room!
bart, you listen.
bart, you're coming home.
hey, the trail of donuts ended. bart!
i'll miss you, son.
son, i know you're upset because you thought you saw us on tv saying we didn't want you in our family. but those were just actors playing us.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. they let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?
that is true.
i can't let the boy see me skipping work.
not at all.
well, i'm opposed to the whole thing! damn opposed!
that's right, money. your money's happiness is all that moneys.
what?!
woo hoo! three hundred fifty dollars!! now i can buy seventy transcripts of "nightline"!
woo hoo!
how come you're not laughing? do you think i'm slow?
and how's my little major leaguer? catch any junebugs today?
son, i know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.
hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
you're steerin' fine, boy... hard to the right!
hard to the left!
we hit the jackpot, here! white gold! texas tea... sweetener.
oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. look at this bible i just got. fifteen bucks! and talk about a preachy book! everybody's a sinner except for this guy.
okay, let's make a pact. this is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families.
oh look! it's the twelve noon robot parade! hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
i kicked one of those stupid itchy characters in the butt.
die, bad robots, die! with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero.
hey, where is everybody?
i mean, heeeyy.
son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all i need.
whew, that's all of 'em. and i'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. how 'bout a present, son?
okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, i'll kill you.
well boy, you won. so i'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. here's your turtle, alive and well.
well lisa, remember that post card grampa sent us from florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?
that's right, we all thought it was hilarious. but it turns out we were wrong. that alligator was sexually harassing that woman.
well, that's kind of a gray area.
son! my dear son. from now on i'm going to be a good and attentive father. and for starters your "old man" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!
some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! but now, i've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
can't.
yes. cris-a-tunity. you're right! i've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. that's it. i'm going to find a new bar to drink in. and i'm gonna get drunker than i've been in my entire life! bart, where's my wallet?
good news, everybody. because i endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want.
permit me to solve the mystery. your mother has a fear of flying.
bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.
so anyway, lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays. and they don't tell me where they go. it's like a conspiracy.
and here's our tv next to the mirror. it looks like we have two.
that's exciting.
it all began about two years ago, before maggie was even born. bart, you were lisa's age and lisa you were the age bart was several years ago.
new job?... marge is pregnant?! nooooo!
well who wouldn't be upset? that new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from sunday! hey, where're you going?
yeah.
absolutely.
well then, i have a back-up plan. see, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
i'm getting to that. so anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
what's everyone so worked up about? so there's a comet. big deal. it'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.
that's it! you people have stood in my way long enough. i'm going to clown college!
you weren't complaining when i got you this close to chachi.
all bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to australia?
oh, yeah, this is the life. boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in orlando, florida?
australia! america! austr--
hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?
and who could forget dear rat boy?
oh, right.
who spread garbage all over flanders' yard before i got a chance to?
you got it.
now it's two sets of twins.
how do you explain the culottes, boy?
so, how was everybody's day at school?
marge, anyone can miss canada... all tucked away down there.
well, i've had just about enough of your vassar bashing young lady.
oh, this is wonderful! you're alive!
nothing. i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
you kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this.
this is the darkest day in the history of springfield. if anybody wants me, i'll be in the shower.
no one in history has ever done anything this clever.
woo-hoo!
berserk is right!! may i have some iced tea, please?
yeah. and who the hell are you talkin' to? marge, do you have other men in this house? radioactive men?
yeah! gimme all the dirt!
yeah, right, lisa. a wonderful, magical animal.
but all normal people love meat. if i went to a barbecue and there was no meat, i would say, "yo, goober! where's the meat?" i'm trying to impress people here, lisa. you don't win friends with salad.
one whopper for the copper.
it's just a little airborne! it's still good! it's still good!
lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.
bart?! is that you?
oh yeah? well it's my house, so it's my spot.
you are?
i'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... i'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... i'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! i don't know...
yuh-huh, that's the deal. no more exercise program! no more traffic! no more blood drives or charity walks!
oh, it's a dream come true, boy! i can, nay, i must, eat everything i've always wanted. now c'mon! every second i'm out of bed, i'm burning precious calories. now get grabbin'!
oh, two-twenty-five?! that means i lost weight!
i've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or i gotta face another day at work.
oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut...
woo hoo hoo hoo! i did it!
don't make me close the shade!
do i know what "rhetorical" means?!
uh... maggie?
jump, boy! i gotcha!
now you, boy!
well, goodnight, son.
yeah.
relax. what is mind? no matter. what is matter? never mind.
go on, maggie. go. go.
bart! bart! time for your sunday night bath, boy!
bart! where are ya, boy.
there you go. now that's not so bad, is it?
bart, you're coming home.
young man, in this house, we use a little word called "please"...
i know how you feel, bart. when i was your age, i wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. well, goodnight.
marge, is lisa at camp granada?
pfft. must have been a pretty slow century.
stealing?! how could you?! haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? captain what's-his-name? we live in a society of laws. why do you think i took you to all those "police academy" movies? for fun? well, i didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? except at that guy who made sound effects. where was i? oh yeah, stay out of my booze!
check it out, boy! it's like looking into a living snow mirror!
ooo! "snappy answers to stupid questions"! i'm great at these. ask me if something smells funny in here, boy.
no, i want roast beef, you clod!
then what are you dressed like that for?
good ol' evergreen terrace. the swankiest street in the classiest part of pressboard estates.
hey, i never noticed this place!
hey! what's wrong with this neighborhood? big shot. too good to buy a house here, snobby?
he spanked you? you, bart simpson?
this is gonna be sweet. two hundred bottle rockets and george bush doing toe touches by an open window.
he's not lost.
it's time to hit him where he lives.
so i thought to myself, what would god do in this situation?
you didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! never!
yay!! we're getting a new tv!!
look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!
i'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. you know, the one i tried to say on the radio? heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?
wow.
don't let krusty's death get you down, boy. people die all the time. just like that. why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. well, good night.
you think so?
yes! yes, sir!
i just feel terrible about getting mr. smithers fired. that job was all he had. imagine how you'd feel, marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do.
for knocking mr. burns out a third story window.
which one's itchy? the car?
oh, it's just bart and a mysterious stranger.
all right... wait a minute. for what?
okay.
what for?
well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... so to answer your question, i don't know.
where are you two going at this hour?
now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
open your eyes, lisa. our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like bart have lost the will to learn.
so how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?
pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?
and when i listen to a really good song, i start nodding my head, like i'm saying "yes!" to every beat. "yes, yes, yes this rocks!" and then sometimes i switch it up like "no, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."
now -- grand funk railroad paved the way for jefferson airplane, which cleared the way for jefferson starship. the stage was now set for the alan parsons project, which i believe was some sort of hovercraft...
i'm just trying to party with you guys.
oh, i get it.
well, excuuuuuuse me!
people know your name, but you don't know theirs. it's great.
nope.
what's with all the questions?
wait, marge. maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool.
bye-bye, job.
hey, he looks just like you, poindexter!
this baby's sure to kill something. okay, now everybody -- stand back while i celebrate freedom. bart, give me your matches.
right. bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.
marge, marge! there i was, i had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when i was abducted by a flying saucer!
we'll never sell this rotten dump.
tom landry's hat! and it's autographed! "to berman's dry cleaning, best wishes, tom landry."
well, the simpson men are doing fine, right, bart? you haven't even gotten in trouble at school.
hey, what happened to your belt?
son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. you've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. coming to me was a good start.
can't they get a pole for that sign?
a whole week of just father and son! see you at dinner.
you know, i don't know.
geez, look at this place. we gotta do something.
do i have to sit up?
'preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. and i gotta live with him.
oh, i don't know how to punish you! what does marge usually do?
oh, yeah, drugs. ya gotta have drugs.
take it off!
hey...
yoink.
that's a door?
hi, kids.
oh. it's bart. i can't believe it. i'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
oh, i suppose you're going to mock me, too.
you do?
thank you, son. and do you think you could stop the casual swearing?
that's my boy. well, if you believe in me, then i'm not going to give up. i'll prove i'm right. this friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!
we'll fake it and sell it to the fox network.
no! no! no-o-o-o-o!
it's gone. and we still don't have any proof.
so burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
huh?
oh yeah. so, you worked for carl, eh?
ooh, i can't get enough of this blood pudding.
i do not!
i prefer to listen to cheap trick.
hey, this is homer simpson sayin'-- i don't sound like that, do i? oh, i don't like having such a hilarious voice.
so it was pretty okay, huh?
then they said they were gonna kill poochie off!
well, i guess i learned my lesson. the thing is, i lost creative control of the project. and i forgot to ask for any money. well, live and learn.
ow! why you little...
no, no! i'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!
oh, and i'm not.
bart! where'd you get that shirt?
all right, boy! come on! today we're gonna--
don't worry, boy. we're gonna set you straight. by tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular burt reynolds.
well it's been two hours. how do you feel?
that's a good start. let's get you a pack. what's your brand?
roscoe here runs this mill. he's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real all-american joes doin' what they do best.
hey, boy, wake up! your old man found some deer!
c'mon, bart. be a sport and kill blitzen, okay?
attaway, son! you made your old man proud!
me too, son.
unnghh!!
bart, look! it's santa claus!
i've been tenderized.
y'know, bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me.
or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before.
going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
take it like a man, boy. and do everything your little sister says.
no.
c'mon, boy, think of a plan.
heh, rex banner. what a dope.
hang on, son!
you see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism.
hey, boy, get crackin'! moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!
call me beer baron.
give me that! bart, this is your father. do you know where the remote is? i looked all over the house.
yes! my precious "cartoons!" "who pumped ethyl?!"
oh, it smells like salmon, too! thanks, boy!
oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day.
geez, that dog has more education than i do. he's some kinda super dog. hey, where'd he go?
who?
laddie?
you gave both dogs away?! you know how i feel about giving!
there, there, shut up, boy. we'll just get you a new dog.
well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. so you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!
rats. i almost had him eating dog food.
the bad dog or the good dog?
see that, boy? why aren't you making any business deals?
it's your life.
oh my god! help me, lisa!
but marge, i'm obsessed with it! where did it come from? what is it a box of? how'd my face get on it?!
well, it was a good ride while it lasted. c'mon kids. let's go home.
no, run around in circles!
well, that's all the time we have. so this is the simpson family saying: "as you walk down the road of life..."
no, no! your room is full of toys. you're going to the, uh, garage!
leggo my leg.
well, bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?
ow!
hey there, meathead. what are you watchin'?
lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better i'll destroy something bart loves.
and that, my children, is the story of bart's first day of school.
bart, son. you wanna play catch?
our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. bart was miserable at school, and lisa's gifts were going to waste.
...and that inscription is still there today.
ohhhh, but marge! am i doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?
he's crazy.
it was your mother.
eh, it'll turn up somewhere.
okay, okay. it's your sugar, bart.
you want me to get the cat down?
and i'm a wonderful man.
there you go, bart, pee wee football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches.
wipe that smile off your face.
i'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. from now on, i'm gonna work you like a dog. now go fetch me twenty laps.
what is it, sweetie?
son, you can do anything you want. i have total faith in you.
since your mother yelled at me. now how 'bout that hug?
not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, flanders?
great debut, son. you really settled in after some early jitters.
hey, everybody! let's hear it for bart!
ah, you guys are some k...
ohh, your mother's not pregnant, is she?
come on, guys. we can't play without bart. he's the heart of this team!
don't listen to them, son. i have total faith in you.
i've got lots of quarters.
aww... you know, tomorrow's the championship game and i could sure use a good offensive tackle.
oh no, my quarterback. what are we gonna do?
"up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..." da-da-da-da-da.
i'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
oh-ho, no! this can't be happening! what the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?
what about me? you didn't thank me.
c'mon, kids. let's try the lights!
well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: god hates us.
what a deal! i'd be a sucker not to get it.
oh, it's true! we weren't robbed! that part we made up! but the rest is true!
maybe so. but there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. this washcloth.
something very close, exactly along those lines--a clint eastwood - lee marvin shoot 'em up western!
they're singing! they're singing, marge! why aren't they killing each other?
no i don't, i think they're bad / they're fake and phoney and totally wrong.
oh-ho, put down your stick. we're here to work.
did ya hear that, bart? the carny code. bart, did you hear that?
yes, sir!
fry up some cheese?
oh. bart?
do i like chicken?
hey, there's a sucker.
i understand.
look at 'em, bart. if a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone.
look at 'em standing out there. no place to go. heh, heh. poor guys. hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?
and what are you charging for this free weekend?
what? what did i say?
that's a negatory, good buddy!
and he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
now that's a fight i wanna be a part of.
from now on, i'm gonna be just like krusty and tell it like it is. marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs.
hey, i thought your mother told you to take a bath.
no, you look a little nervous, lisa.
that's my girl. you just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. moe will take care of everything.
aw, thanks, boy. i'll give you two packs for that candy bar.
why you little...
room for one more...
we'll tape it!
yes, son. a spectacular failure.
uh-oh.
"do the message! da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."
aw, that's sweet, honey. i'll bring you back a hat.
no.
you're a disgrace to this family and its proud naval tradition!
well, i guess that's everyone. except earring-boy.
well, when i was ten i got my ear pierced but this is completely different!
boy, i guess i was wrong about that earring. it saved us all.
i don't think so, son.
no.
ask your mother.
no.
okay, marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, lisa's a clergyman, maggie is seven people and bart was wounded in vietnam...
quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. it goes all the way to the president.
this "filthy monkey" made the orange juice you're drinking.
oh, i don't need your pity.
i guess.
kiss it.
so long, chicken bone.
no room for you, jell-o.
yeah, but i'm always secretly disappointed when you do. anyway, i think those garbage men are starting to crack.
apologize for that remark.
okay, before i show ya, who wants to guess how i got the money?
sorry, son, daddy's down for the day. why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?
i agree. let's surrender.
aww. goodbye, everyone. don't touch my stuff.
well, yeah...
oh, man, this is hard.
why don't you tell me, son? see any interesting flags up there?
aw, dammit!
but marge, the gilded truffle is an intimate, elegant place.
hello, everybody.
and now for the profit taking.
where do you think you're goin'?
woo hoo!
yeah, but your mom paid for that.
wow, look at that load of grease. boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.
oh i'll say. look at that redheaded kid. there must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
emus? really? oh, that's pretty crazy... nah... i'd only fail just like i fail at everything.
dear lord, i know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. but if you help us steal this grease tonight, i promise we'll donate half the profits to charity.
this better work, boy. i don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm.
what is it?
bringin' up the rear.
and now we wait. so... is this your school?
oh. i see you're having a party. i'll come back later.
oh, all right. maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong.
all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir.
oh, i shoulda punted. turn it off! turn it off!
de de de de de.
and these hardy boys books are great, too. this one is about smugglers.
yes. thomas edison smoked several cigars a day.
probably needs to be more powerful.
sure! believe me, every man in america will want to have one.
really? you think it's a good idea?
awdammit!
i thought i had a great idea, but i must've seen it on this poster.
that chair might be the only one he made.
so, we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it! then i'll be an inventor!
aw, to hell with him!
outta the way. this is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!
look, son. edison was just like me.
we're not rivals. we're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. i can't destroy your work, my friend.
no, but we'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home...
well, that's it.
look at me, bart! i'm driving!
sure it didn't.
stupid cards.
who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
it's hammer time, snitchy.
oh, my god!
there. now no murderers can get in... or out.
you are sooo dead.
i love you, son.
mama took those batteries / she took 'em away / mama took those batteries / size double a...
huh? oh, okay... let's see... "pause," "three," no "fa-fa"...
ohh... ahh...
no, that would make me a great father.
screw this. hang on, everyone. we're takin' the ol' simpson shortcut.
well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies.
life jackets?
here we go!
higher, i say! i want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! i want to look down on the clouds with contempt! i want to sneer at god's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh.
when kim makes a manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. and would it kill you to put some fennel in it?
well, there were script problems from day one.
i didn't choose to be a gifted actor, marge. it chose me. i'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. now help me make up some phony credits.
no way, narc. bodily functions are a natural thing.
perhaps in time.
aww, you're just saying that.
i'm way ahead of you.
steamed maine cabbages!
pinchy, i made you some risotto.
sorry, marge. pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. but don't worry. i put him in a nice hot bath.
oh, man, that's good. pass the butter.
i'm done.
let's see. one, two, three... six whiskeys!
well now that's what i always thought, but somehow...
hmmm...
well, beats work.
oh, how was i supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?
hold it! what's your clearance?
access denied.
... and after moe's, we went to krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and i ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. and then apu gave the mayor lots of change for...
bart, no!
ten dollars?! what is this, a car wash for millionaires?
you mean that one with the red paint?
especially me.
so, who won? the losers?
hello, big maggie.
well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? acting childish. kidnapping. child abuse...
well, turn something on. i'm starting to think.
bo-ring. go back to that infamy guy.
i have a problem.
well, at least they've already done me.
speak for yourself! bart, get down here! i'm gonna spank you back to the stone age!
okay, moe. i believe you had me by the throat. reverend lovejoy was working the body...
you guys are following me? i was following flanders.
the whole town's laughin' at me. even that cat out there. bart, kill that cat!
dynamic, isn't it?
and it doesn't stop in the bedroom. oh no, i'm taking charge. kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the max power way.
sh-sh-sh. anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon...
gimme that!
oh, marge, you saved me!
okay, bart, it's your turn to pick. where are we headed? bowling? demolition derby? p.j. o'harrigans? isn't that a funny name? huh? huh?
this is all your fault for trading away your turn. just for that, no dessert tonight!
fonzie's jacket!
that's right, "the odd couple." so meet your comically mismatched roommate, bart simpson.
hey, that looks like fun.
so i said to that nurse, "you can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."
greenhorns! who's a greenhorn? what's a greenhorn?
huh? oh, right. the steak.
so much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
i've got to, honey. i owe it to ol' red, as both his friend and his killer.
don't you have school?
why you gotta... come on! ah! now i'm gettin' the hang of this thing. i don't know why i didn't become a trucker before.
oh, yeah? my left arm says different.
aww... that's a nice, friendly gal.
wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? watching all the people come and go. you could have a different best friend every day.
i bet ol' red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
relax, boy. we're ahead of schedule.
hey, bart, watch me run down this old lady.
c'mon out, boy. it's windy.
look, son. it's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy.
i think we lost 'em, bart.
all right.
i'm keeping a promise to an american roadmaster.
red. the trucker. big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?
well, son. i guess it's time to go home.
oh, man. this is the hottest easter ever.
how 'bout it, bart? would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?
good work, honey. keep it comin'.
it's glorious! the streets are paved with water. you could ride a walrus to work!
adios, "casa de flanders."
step two: snorkel the animals.
now, step three...
well, you said i couldn't do it, but here it is! meet abby the olympic tabby.
knowing you always hate my first idea, i prepared a backup. how about a big olympic hello for springy, the springfield spring!
it's fun for the whole family. and the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
the internet? is that thing still around?
hey, you know, i once knew a man from nantucket.
mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. hey, what's baby huey doing?
i didn't... what is it? lunch?
could someone please whack my hernia back in?
marge! your shoe!
and i've been lookin' for you, too, pal!
okay, while mel and i are working, why don't you guys do the town? i hear all the stars eat at a place called planet hollywood.
it's all about trust, honey.
some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
andy dick...
son, let's forget all about that drug thing. why don't you just come down and have some taffy?
do i get a card?
hmm. my career has kinda lost momentum...
hey, i had lenny's name on that!
why don't you just tell everybody?
here we are kids -- the zoo.
can ya believe it, marge? this job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!
he's undead, all right.
well, son. i guess this is the end. but we've both had long, full lives. oh, right.
i can't believe i destroyed the earth.
ooh, there's ross perot, dr. laura, spike lee...
tom arnold?! what the hell's going on?!
rural route 9? that's it! we can hide out at the farm where i grew up!
yeah, it'll be fun. fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides...
absolutely. this is our big chance. the simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
all right, let's see what the old girl can do.
go get lassie.
yeah, i hope i can grow some like that.
and for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... i'm down.
sorry, boy. going back to springfield would be a coward's way out.
bup, no fighting, boys.
oh, great. i got a field full of mutants.
don't push. there's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
listen, boy... i was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention.
he's named after what he is.
man, the last nine months sure were crazy.
free baby cola? apu hits the jackpot, and i'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets.
promise you won't laugh?
i don't know how.
will you teach me?
... and those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look i get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
really? read it.
oh, that's sweet.
hey, why is this door locked?
writhing funzos / in my sack / makes me happy / makes me hurt my back...
hey, it is christmas. we'd better get home.
oh. that was scary. we came this close to losing our spare christmas tree stand. you monster.
hey, let's go skiing right now!
we'll be fine, honey. the main thing is for you to get better.
come on, "bikini inspector!" "scrub toilet?" okay, that was a practice. practice... practice... okay, here we go. "feed fish."
that's not true, he left it on the bus.
it's the bread of astronauts.
marco!
marco!
marc--
you don't? 'cause that's what i said! tell her, bart.
leprosy? i can't believe it! that fortune cookie was right.
mops? the cure sounds worse than the disease.
this place is a blast. all we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing.
and chili fries!
bart, i need a miracle!
we made it, son. international waters -- the land that law forgot.
that was my plan all along. now relax and the currents will take us home.
i don't know. after living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.
i stand by my disappointed groan.
mmm, that's terrific, duncan. you're ten for ten. now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the nfl.
huh?
you can do it, duncan. i don't care if your odds are... five million to one!?
cheer up, son. i thought you looked damn good out there. oh, wait. you were number "5"? eew! you stin... damn good.
son, don't ask why, but you have to lose the big race.
oh, it is, it is. but we've been pushing that poor horse too hard.
well, it is a good life, believe me... all right, we'll give it a shot. i'll deal with those murderous trolls.
better do what he says, marge.
oh, yeah. that's it, baby, that's the money shot. yeah, the camera loves you. oh-ho-ho, you tease, you.
you'll see...
oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. chicks really dig sensitivity. did you get that, bart?
hey, i'm as surprised as you, but i've stumbled upon the most delicious british sit-com.
it's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. if they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker.
the mother's the voice of reason.
done and done.
really? without tv, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends.
oh, really? well, if you'll excuse me, i've got some civilization to spread like butter on the english muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies...
hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya.
oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!
oh, here we go.
oh, i'm tired of giving you money. why can't you be more like lisa?
you should've thought of that before you dropped out of the devry institute.
i'm still cool.
ah, trash night. in france, they call it "la nuit des poubelles." in germany, it's "crappenfest."
well, this muscle shirt's a pretty good find.
all i know is, i'm finally getting the support i need.
...and three makes three.
ooh, my first issue of "self-test monthly." finally i get to find out what makes me tick.
look out for what?
yep, this place is great. and someday, when lisa and bart get married, it'll all be theirs.
okay, but i ain't payin' for two weddin's.
much better.
ch-ch-ch-changes / time to change the oil / yeah / changes / don't wanna be an oily man /
but we never saw people like us on tv.
not now. i'm busy turning on this washing machine.
good.
son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.
television broken?
it's a badger all right... or possibly a griffin. bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?
hey, that's not me!
it's not fair! i've been a fan of the who since the very beginning, when they were the hillbilly bugger boys.
nice wiring, bart.
read my lips: yes.
oh yeah? they think they're better than us, huh? bart, c'mere a minute.
uh...
this watermelon won't know what hit it.
eh, it's hopeless.
yeah, it's hopeless.
you want money? get a job, like your old man.
so, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?
no, really.
i don't need to rehearse. ho, ho, ho, merry... line!
you'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not.
no kiddin'. what do you think of my page, lisa? be honest. it's great, isn't it? go ahead and say it's great if you want to.
they can't sue me if they don't know who i am. i'll just call myself mr. x.
that lousy pothole! why don't they fix it?
get out! who told you that?
nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. nelson is gold.
so she was made of chimps.
i can't afford that.
okay, we'll move. we don't want any trouble, fellas.
sixty cents?! i would've made more if i'd gone into work today!
a good son would come through for his dad!
i told you! i find them boring.
oh, that's it! you can walk home!
stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car.
is that a steak?
who gave you all this money?
oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! we could make a fortune.
well, yeah. but god conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs.
there ya go! we'd be stealing from people we know. it's just like the seasons.
they have any father-and-son grifts?
interesting.
you bet. let's trim the mark.
... of integrity.
yes, son?
in a way. but i also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. plus the baldness.
we'll be safe here.
oh... my... god.
he's dead.
i guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting.
colgate cavity patrol?
absolutely. we had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... bart, would you call him a crazy man?
well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some...
uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly.
hey, where's your blue shirt?
ow! owww, my back. dr. steve didn't do anything.
i feel fantastic!
not "trash can," son. dr. homer's miracle spine-o-cylinder! patent pending.
don't worry your spiky little head. i've got it all planned out.
that's tennis?! then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
get off my property.
hey there, son!
with that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament.
it's gonna be tough without a partner.
well, good for you! anyone i know?
no. no, no, no. you're my partner.
i don't think they saw me.
my manhood? i never thought of that!
hey, leave my teammate alone!
don't listen. it's a trick!
which one am i? serena or venus?
you know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff.
what's on tv?
so, ah, what songs did i miss?
yeah, that's the look.
but... the tv gave me the impression that...
well, you're welcome, honey. now, i'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. got a problem, bart?
oh, my head. how long have i been out here?
i was? but i love the swing.
don't worry. duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
"olive oil?" "asparagus?" if your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people.
in the cart.
my doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that...
y'know, i always felt sorry for marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun.
ow! what the hell?
not a chance.
i told you, yes. now bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel.
go.
so like us...
man, this is taking forever. i know how to speed things up.
what? that doesn't sound like me.
you're doing that the sucker way. try a little vitamin g.
i'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other godly hoo-hah.
why won't you light? the gas is on full blast!
well, i can still hang out with you guys.
peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo!
'cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...
the simpsons are ridin' the rails!
good idea, mr. ed. wanna come along, noodle neck?
won't you marry me, bi-ill? / i got the wedding gown bi-ill / 'cause weddings are ni-ice...
...honey. you know, this could be fun. race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball.
run, bart! pump your thighs! pump them...
i thought i would hate working nights. but it's so peaceful. and there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
sure, boy.
oh, son. you know that's none of your business. say, is that our house?
really. you like skateboards? we're sure learning a lot about each other.
that's my little slugger.
well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
no!
but...
hey, shut up.
ow! why you--!
because i... ow! you--!
oh hello, young man. beautiful day for digging, isn't it?
yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?
so, i guess you wouldn't mind if i was to dig a hole of my own.
maybe i will.
yello?
ooo, bart! my first prank call. what do i do?
i don't get it.
what's the gag?
freshen your drink, pal?
someone's yellow belly is showing.
when you have a rib-eye steak / you must floss it / oh, that meatloaf tasted great / you must floss it / now floss it, floss it good.
science!?
now all we need is our astronaut. bart, where's america's newest hero?
so, you think you know better than this family, huh. well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what i do and believe what i believe. so butter your bacon!
hold that thought. bacon up that sausage, boy.
new shooter.
i'm good for the rest, you know i am.
i would if it wasn't for the kids.
woo hoo!
oh my god! wow. now that's a goiter.
i've used up all these records.
remember what i told you about running away from your troubles?
uh-oh.
oh, what do i do? what do i do?
no. the olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
yeah, one time, she-- oh, she's looking at us. be cool.
canada? why should we leave america to visit america junior?
there she is, boy.
listen to me, son. no one loves a quitter. so you go over there and you win her back.
oh, right.
hey boy, where'd you get that hat?
no kidding? hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks.
swell.
well, i thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?
you don't need that.
aren't you forgettin' someone?
oh yeah, i checked that out when bart was born. i was gonna read to him every day.
that mini-van had the biggest cup holders. and change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!
son, how's it going with the breakfast pâté?
our next story is "hamlet," by william shakespeare.
now that's what i call a moon shot.
boy, did you make a prank call to brazil?
get me tools and beer.
how did i get here?
then it's settled. the simpsons are going to brazil.
woo hoo!
hey, and a mini-bar hat.
ahhh...
hey, bart. how many more places do we have to search?
eh, same old garbage!
all right. i'll do it for my kids.
ow!
my ice cream sandwich! then where the hell's the remote?!
why do people keep moving it... stupid...
uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for "angry dad: the motion picture".
you're trying to get me angry, thank you.
i love you, boy.
stop it now.
hi-yo!
hey, apu, i think she likes you.
if he wants to sleep with us, forget it.
no.
no.
no! i've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that santa claus. no more irresponsible behavior.
yeah. wiggum couldn't catch cooties at milhouse's birthday party.
what a character.
what? wait a... that can't be right! wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?
oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?
hey, what's this suitcase for? are we going on a trip?
you can't just leave me out here! there's not another woman for miles!
i knew nothing!
my dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. i was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. i'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing.
stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. nice going, geniuses.
oh, it's red wire to red wire. what idiot dreamed that up?
mmm... feed...
the status quo.
shut up, boy.
so how do you afford such a sweet pad?
if we formed a club we could serve drinks.
well then, you might as well stay with us. we serve the same meat the prisons do!
you know what made me feel better about myself? that award i got for world's greatest dad.
disney world?
gator gulch?
oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god.
more free samples.
oh, lisa's still mad at me.
yep, but you're still safe at home. after a few practice trips here, the real kwik-e-mart will be a piece of cake. now, bart will play apu...
listen kids, your mom is going to be living in the basement. but with our love, she'll get better soon.
bart, eat your spinach.
no, actually, i'm going to eat twice as much.
'mornin' kids! i made your lunches. they're on the table.
yeah, well, nachos are nachos.
look, this church is our only option. don't you kids want to live here?
i can't get enough of you, baby...
god's ignoring me.
la la la la la la la. nothing left. la la la... la... la.
see, bart. i saved you.
of course, because you wouldn't want to... i paid for your splendor, you...!
you know son, i've been doing a lot of thinking. i was wrong to exploit you, and i won't do it again.
so, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?
i'm challenging you, hawk. in front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it.
woo hoo! i rule this pseudo sport! come back to me, boy!
what did they say about my scalp?
wow, i can't wait to pack that into my colon.
i got arm veins, don't i?
oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire.
children, so naïve.
this is it, boy. with this bird gone, the plant will be mine for the taking.
lisa, i deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce.
well, i have to work, but give the monitor a kiss.
from now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest dad.
oh, you want a piece of me?
night... glorious night...
i hope it's as fun as pictionary was last week.
or when i messed up taping "city slickers 2" and cut off the end. was curly's gold just a legend?
kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think.
marge, please. let's not fight in front of the kids. just secretly hate me the way you always have.
why you little...!
you noticed! i've been using lancôme.
what? it said "take one."
no! i wanted to die choking on food!
check it out, beavers. delicious motel furniture!
that's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
woo hoo! in your face, imaginary guy!
don't worry, son. i'll build you a new treehouse. one so grand it'll be an affront to god himself.
well, two can play at that game.
welcome back to the family, boy.
kent, let me make this perfectly clear. i have no dog.
my wads! i never even broke the wrapper.
help! help! i'm drowning!
to me that says "i love you."
i did it. i walked all the way to moe's from my house.
now i'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.
let's see. what native american activities should we do? making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the civil war.
well i'm not finished. where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. she--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!
no way! i'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. but if i lose maggie, i'm oh-for-three. i've gotta get her back.
beat the lumps. beat the lumps. beat the lumps.
hm.
from what, too much hot fudge? huh? c'mon bart, show me some love!
psst. hey pal. hey buddy. wake up. wanna go on an adventure with your old man?
they all do.
you weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and i want you to see it.
i couldn't sleep, because i thought there might be a sign of my mom in one of these articles. they never did find her body.
oh, i'm so confused.
one thousand dollars. do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
well, we put up a flyer.
dear god of england: please let me go. in return i will spell the word "color" with a "u" and i'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, i can't do it. it's so stupid!
flow... yeah.
gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him.
no way. if something happens to me, you have to carry on the simpson name.
i never realized how hot this suit is. i'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
suh-weet.
son, can i have cuts?
oh god, it's baby blood!
you can't leave, i'm your ride home!
isn't it sufficient.
pathetic flanders. thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.
bart, that creepy kid's here!
a ten-speed bike?! what did your mother say?
yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works.
son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?
i'll assemble it myself.
i can make a bike. i made you.
bike's over there.
like a dog. or a snowman!
"...i'd love to be with you, but i just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. will meet you later. love, dad.
not so rough, bart. daddy can't handle so much love right now.
well, i've been busy, son. they really need me over at the nuclear plank.
bart, i'm sorry -- i could never build a robot this awesome. i'm a fraud.
affirmative.
you really think so?
he knows just how i like my martinis... full of alcohol.
bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside.
son, did you ever suspect it was me?
maybe on planet zoozoo.
hoo boy, are you in trouble.
where's the "ee-yow?"
you didn't sit on the toilet!
butt on bowl, little man!
i'm taking you all out for tacos!
what would jesus view?
no way! he's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
i miss you guys so much. the smell of marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my "owies" when i go boom... this place has become like a prison to me!
that's it. from now on i'm not looking forward to anything. oh my god, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! i can't wait!
that was you!?
i drank this much!
if you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?
i sure am. here you go, son. i brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge.
love you.
don't worry, i've got a man on the perimeter.
this is fat load. i'd like to request a new codename.
okay, fat load here.
and the castrati?
son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain "payoffs."
we're alone now.
aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down.
what's wrong, son?
wherever injustice shows its ugly face, i will be there! for i am the pie man!
mr. simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?
permission to treat this witness as hostile.
why? because i only kissed one girl in my whole life? that's still one more than you.
no, no, no, let her finish.
just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. but don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy.
talk about boats! then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't.
okay, kids show off your pipes...
bart, you're grounded for a year.
what man would want you now?
your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
maybe i was a little hard on him. oh, well. bart, i know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. but what's going on up here?
uh-um... what do you think "some" is?
do you know what a boob is?
good. that'll save us some time. okay... why do you think your mother and i sleep in the same bed?
every simpson starts with a circle. daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. hm, i'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an "m" and a "g."
oh, i love to see my man eat.
nice try, loser. i bet you made up a fake test.
marge! i figured out a way we can get in on this quimby lawsuit! bart, go ahead.
all right. but while i'm gone, boy, you think about what you did.
i wouldn't say that.
oh yes you are. why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle.
yeah, that's how it starts.
i've been reading this magazine for years, but i never dreamed my son would be on the cover.
bart, can i ask you an important question?
twenty-nine ninety-nine.
woo hoo!
no problem. bart, i need two hundred dollars.
what's the matter, boy?
well, i'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son.
see you in hell, document!
i win...
what's a cuckold?
dammit! i never win anything! ooh, here's something i'm good at.
easy... gentle...
go to hell.
fine, go nuts.
son, your mother makes a very loud point...
if that's true, he's gonna be like nwa -- not without ass-welts.
y'ello?
oh son!... taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing i've ever done.
hey, what can i say? i love love.
correction. the first blimp that got her pregnant.
dios mio!
sorry, boy. this is the only place that's two hundred feet from lisa but still on our property.
kids, your mother and i have decided to take a little break from each other. while we deal with our issues, i plan to go on "motorhome makeover" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. all i need is for someone to start a show called "motorhome makeover."
deal!
listen to me! this whole building is unsafe. they cut corners everywhere. people, it's a death trap!
you don't know the half of it.
high-five!
but that's not true, bart saw him at the builder's barn.
well, that's a world of difference. light me up, doc!
aw, what did he die of?
you get better, son. meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the "library."
did you hear that foxy, the fox network fox?
marge, i'm giving birth to a food baby.
i'm not mr. simpson. that ship has sailed. i'm colonel cool! and i'm the captain on this rocket to the stars.
but sweetheart, i have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this.
why you little... i'll teach you to have a libido!
son, i need to pee, but i can't stop watching. fetch me a bottle.
don't worry, marge. i've taken every precaution.
me? but i'm the father.
kids, i'm sure your mother will be back soon.
look, we've been down this road before. i do something stupid, your mom leaves, we eat waffles.
gotta find your mom. gotta find your mom.
okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. i have cousins near here. we'll stay with them.
oh, the rubiest. ooh look! a new restaurant chain!
okay. to save the manatees, i guess i could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that.
stupid best friend flanders.
okay, how about this? seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. everyone forget that.
no one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
the brakes are shot.
where's lisa, boy? this book's gonna solve all her problems.
can't even go in my own kitchen... bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
now featuring the pox box! pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. like any disease box, results may vary. pox box!
gladly.
bart! we're all disappointed there's no potato salad! but for god's sake, don't jump!
okay.
david, you're by far the best son i've ever had. uh-oh.
lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. in the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the american dream.
the sad part is, there were times when i actually had feelings for you. i almost felt i was your father.
david feels, and your mother will agree when i tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it.
honey, animals don't feel death. that was proved by the scientists at black angus.
woo hoo! pizza for breakfast!
oh, can i come with you? i know i can't.
what a great father's day!
uh, well, my son is here too. let's meet him now.
son, i need to find a new friend for your mother. so you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself.
marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
i get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
yeah, i tell marge everything! not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such.
hey guys, i have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then i'll be back to go to vegas!
boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system.
oh yeah?! you're going to that camp, 'cause i'm gonna drive you there.
stupid bart... makes me drive to oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of matt groening ...
you mean fun homer? i'm afraid serious homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
eh.
boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act.
look at me, i use a napkin.
i bet they're from massachusetts. you know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son.
boy! push down on the bumper! then i can back the car up and save myself.
well boy, you made the right choice. i think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us.
i don't enjoy it. being a father is just a job. long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling "you screwed me up"!
wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!
son, i'm doing something i should have done a long time ago... taking you to vegas!
lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. if they did, then my experiments could be called cruel.
oh really? bart, when did you get your tenure?
hey, marge it's what i've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury.
just outsource it to lisa. outsourcing is the answer to everything.
may firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
screw you! i'm never gonna pay!
son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, entertainment weekly. now, for once, i'm getting' rich-person mail. you wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?
yeah, but he's cool with it. right?
yeah, they beat me up at work. look at the word they wrote on my skull.
boy, get dressed. you're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!
oh, son. i like you more, now that other people like you.
deal!
mmm... extra-virgin...
still hungry.
i'll savor you!
what happened to "for better or for worse?!"
hey, milhouse.
what's goin' on?
hey boy, where's your mud buddy? i have a little job for him.
lisa, that was just a radio show.
no one makes my daughter sob and run.
marge?
oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. but you still have to go.
son, we all have to do things we don't want to. like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be mr. funny all the time -- you think i wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? like some ancient pagan! just dancing around playing the pan flute! and here we are!
gunderson!
bart!? what the hell are you doing in there?!
aw, son.
shiiiii... pwreck!
do you think your mother will ever remarry?
this is it. it's taken all day, we've missed our flight to hawaii, but finally, i'll get my revenge.
no, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it.
then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
yeah, how 'bout that?
son, one day you're going to be a great father.
thanks, boy. hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while i sing public domain songs out the window?
now that i'm super-wealthy, i can buy them whatever their hearts desire. that's why rich kids turn out so well.
oh, i get it. these are those trick candles you can't blow out.
the clown on this cereal box is just a person!
okay boy, do something annoying. but leave yourself room to build.
son, i'll never understand women if i live to be forty.
you said it -- enjoy me while i last.
wanna watch me?
okay, here's the solution -- i want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so i can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief.
i have three kids and no money! why can't i have no kids and three money?
zombie kill.
is that one?
look at me! i'm a fireman!
so daddy saved apu and moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson.
where the hell is abigail adams?! oh, there she is. where the hell is mary todd lincoln?! oh, she's right there. where the hell is ida saxton mckinley?! oh i see. where the hell is--
no. and never bring it up again.
you butcher!
almost ready! here we go.
okay. hold still. this is the last picture on the role.
sure do. let's go get ice cream!
oh my god, this is amazing! wait, i'm gonna be driving. i'll go for the cup.
oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!
dinner with mr. burns! what a waste of my precious, precious saturday night.
if you're gonna film me, i insist on a body double.
will you shut up? i can't hear the song in my head!
i couldn't bear to tell your mother, so i hang out here all day.
brands like "miser's choice" and "day-old delights?"
denny's.
my back! it hurts, and not in a good way!
woo-hoo!
singing opera made me good at painting.
guess what, boy. last night i towed your principal's car.
wow, bart! lookin' good!
what?! name twelve.
don't worry, sir. i'll handle this cleanly, quietly and bart!
why do you think i'm kicking it?
oh, lighten up. it's halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment.
mmm... porkpie.
kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother.
then it was all a dream. i never became a hideous monster.
i sure have. plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. when it is, everyone should get it.
he cheats at uno!
hmmm... the only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
i thought global warming would take care of it. al gore can't do anything right.
things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. why can't this be the tunnel of hockey fights?
wanna take a ride with your old man?
c'mon. c'mon. oh c'mon.
what's the matter, son?
aw, don't give up, boy. i believe in you -- and not just because i have to.
son, i know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. but since then, i've really come to respect you. and unlike love, respect can't be bought.
what?! i'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
c'mon, boy. all the nerds are doin' it.
son, while your mother and little mother are out, i'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret.
have you ever wondered what i do in that locked room?
well wonder no more!
wait, wait, wait, wait! you haven't seen our power point presentation. bart?
who could have done this?!
enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits homer simpson... hey, they're not sleepy. they're just turning fuzzy...
that wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.
come on out, boy.
okay, bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. step one: we chuck the raccoon in there.
come on, preen harder! make them hate you! you feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!
lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. why can't i leave for thirty years?
well... it might be cold outside.
yeah, me too. since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word "pop" out of all of our foods.
that's right.
don't you worry about wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. we'll change a lot of things.
all right, time to dig in. i brought everything we need.
the food is all around us.
you stupid kid! what if i walked in here barefoot?
quirky? quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! you made us look like monsters!
i never wanted to be famous for being mean. i wanted to be famous for catching santa claus.
i know! kinda miss it.
don't worry -- i'm ready for this. bart, fetch "the defender."
why would a robber make pie?
she said i didn't suck?
that bad. wow.
mom, i'm so sorry. you just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. well, if i get out of this i promise you i'll grant your last wish.
son... all hobbies suck. but if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time.
do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
this is a classic nineteen seventy-eight pizza hut! mmm... terrible.
aaaaannnnnd done.
here you go, son. shell casings.
point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
our little boy has lost his mind. let's get him.
stupid shopping list, turning food into work. bart!
hmmm, you make a good case. i'll take it!
you just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
get out here, boy! i wanna punish you before i get drunk and merciful!
you ruin everything! /
i'll be anything and everything you want! don't leave me here with them!
how dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! bart! don't you dare take your eyes off that gameboy!
kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me.
now we wait for the river to freeze. if my theory of global cooling is correct.
but we're married.
how about r?
milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... salaam alaikum!
what's the matter? don't like the taste of freedom?
u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
they're just drones, lisa. they only live for like five minutes anyway. and they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and bart.
we... i... you come up with an excuse!
okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard.
the guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's god. well, god doesn't need his own special day!
guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
yes! i want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame.
i respect your choice. now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a tom collins.
uh, yes. that must be it. this is the best of all possible worlds. blah, blah, blah.
hey, was there another plaque here before?
god no!
who taught you that language?!
boy, where are my zydeco records?
i know they do, but the simpson mardi gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. and we spare no expense.
poltergeist in the closet...
so, after i paid for the ice cream cones, i said "thank you" and was on my way.
no, i'm gonna see it first!
kids, i have to tell your mom i lost maggie.
please, can i get it, marge? please? please?
hmm. probably a reminder to relax more.
gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
i need that paper quick!
boy.
look, man, i don't want any trouble. c'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. leave me alone, okay?
don't have one.
son, from now on, i'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!
buddy, i'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation.
well, i know when i'm not wanted. am i wanted?
look at all these helicopter parents. i hope bart's doing okay on his own.
hey boy, why don't i do that for you?
all the other parents are doing it for their kids. now stand back and i'll take it from here. a little further back.
yes! yes! in your face, losers! this helicopter is taking off!
c'mon, boy! be cool!
eh, they can go to hell. bart?
what'd you think, kids?
no... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
hm, i don't know -- kernels are kind of big.
when you say "teacher," do you really mean "parent?"
great. go nuts. but remember, we never had this discussion.
not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly.
ask him.
ultimate punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. studies have shown your mother is right.
it wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a bavarian castle!
what'd i miss?
how can i control her?! i have nothing to withhold!
marge, i tried my best to talk you out of this. but since you're going through with it, i beg you, just stay out of his way and don't get hurt.
no holds barred.
i can't make sense of that muncher talk!
i think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?
ooo, mouth.
son, i love you kids. but i'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and i ain't comin' out.
girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and i don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause i don't know.
holy moly!
aw c'mon, marge. there's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head.
do you want to come in and get your sister with me?
watch your language! now, why the hell not?
oops -- the frisbee went into the bushes. why don't you go find it?
why you little...
you go rent us a truck.
hm. not as much money as there used to be.
lenny... and carl... a fortune cookie... i ran into the candy machine... and i found an emerson, lake, and palmer...
son, if i was interested in fun, i would've run away the day you were born.
you're right. i have been acting like telethon jerry lewis when i should've been acting like rest-of-the-year jerry lewis. will you teach me how to put myself first?
sorry boy. you have school tomorrow.
boy, i am through spoiling you. first thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed.
up -- that's my chair, boy.
i agreed to no such thing!
where and what time?
never!
fine. let me just get my harness pads.
boy, this has gone too far -- i quit! as soon as i finish these oats.
not if i tell her first.
what the... you're a month behind on homework?!
no line... near the men's room... i see no reason to question your choice.
whatever. knock yourself out.
you may not realize this, bart, but your mother and i have been fighting about you a lot lately. and i've realized our marriage is more important than your future. from now on, you're on your own.
yeah.
don't know, don't care.
and when you're out of my sight, you must constantly twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though i don't know what twitter is and have no desire to find out.
your mother thinks i'm working on the car!
talk to grampa. he used to be a man.
no! if you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.
look at that.
flanders, you're not supposed to help him.
hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. what are you up to?
i'm more than okay! i am the messiah, come to save the world! look upon me and shudder!
patty and selma are dead? woo hoo! a double funeral!
you used to be nicer!
oh lisa, i'm sorry. i tried my best. i know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect.
guess what company had a giveaway at moe's last night?
what's it say, boy?
hey boy, whatcha doing?
sorry, honey. i wasn't listening. and i won't be listening now.
that is disgusting.
hmmmm. not ugly enough. i want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
you never fail to nauseate me, boy.
half an hour to show time, your ugliness.
but if we win this, we get a gift certificate.
another good one...
wait! not so fast! we found something to save krusty.
no fair! we just went to church!
fifty bucks each?! that's your life savings?!
you stink!
be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
just don't dress me up like a woman.
now boy, everyone in town gets burns for half an hour to do as they will.
okay, burnsie, follow the carrot!
all finished, boy.
is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken i played, lost to, and ate at the state fair?
what they don't suspect is that i'm into this.
stupid dog! let go of that delicious bird!
i mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
now to take care of the witnesses.
whose turn is it to cry?
it's okay, it's okay. i can be out in eighteen months with good behavior.
can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
because you're my best friend in the room.
right... neither am i.
because when you get anything you want, you don't want anything you get.
someday you'll understand that i'm just being a good dad.
son, i won't strangle you anymore, but i also won't get you that mini-bike.
and if you do it, son, you'll get the same.
son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work.
well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends.
because you've been such a great kid lately and i wanted to show you i appreciated it.
step away from the traitor!
hey! don't you know it's awards season? who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
you got your wish, boy. i'm proud of ya. i'm sorry i took all the credit.
why are you guys eating so fast?
it better be tonsillitis.
bart, cheech and chong were the beavis and butthead of their day!
hide the dope!
oh no! chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
come on, party pooper -- bust a move!
aw, come on, sourpuss. tickle tickle!
tickle tickle too!
tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!
hello, boy.
i want you to know i'm cured.
go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
oh come on, bust your daddy's chops.
boy, get down from there!
how many more, sir?
these are my keys.
it's "a-b-c-1-2-3"! it's the easiest song in the world!
pretty sweet, eh boy?
i want my pot of gold!
i was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired.
woo hoo! first in line! brought you a gift bag.
bart, take the controls!
blimp assassin three.
xbox.
boy! stomp on my head!
don't panic, son. we can bust up teachy and preachy. here's what we do: i'll take flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. you scare rod and todd by telling them krabappel will become their evil stepmother.
later, losers.
bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.
come on! god does crazy things! check your old testament.
hey bart... i mean, jesus. hey son, you want flanders to kill anybody? he's totally in my power.
and i sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
and check these out...
wow, video games sure have changed since i was a kid. how many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? thirty thousand? certainly not fifty.
i won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
man, how many quarters does this game take?
oh no, i don't eat anything new unless i've eaten it before!
pine needle... sorbet... pine needle sorbet!! my kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it "sherbert" and they wish it was ice cream!
all right, you can each have one toy.
a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
we're taking down kids who read.
i'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
tween-lit gang-write. but this babar needs a zephyr.
you're the zephyr.
the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript.
so, does this square us for kansas city?
somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something.
oh sorry, sweetie. bart can read it to you.
it's closing?! but where will people find clips of old tv shows if they're not housed in a giant building? where? where?
fatso flanagan!
finally. the only thing i wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
don't argue in front of the airport line. strangers are judging our marriage!
yes, but i never use that kind of toothpaste!
i'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. i...
this is going so great. i'm already a halloween mask.
leave her alone! that's my only talking daughter!
oxygen... i need oxygen.
boy, i told you an hour ago. stop that!
please. put that down.
eh, i'm sick of watching fox. let's get some fresh air. i got the atv's right out back.
springfield talk!
hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes.
well, i've tightened the bolt! i think we're good!
man, oh man, look at this place! finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something.
aw... i mean arrrgh!
why you little... i'm gonna get... no, homer. you can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. juries hate that. so instead, boy, i want you to... get in that rabbit cage!
i've been thinking. i really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. so i'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
what?
boy, get out of that cage!
heard about this thing, boy?
look at me, i'm mr. fatso! it's funny 'cause it's so preposterous.
well, we do.
you just ruined my car.
five hundred dollars? woo-hoo! thanks, boy.
really, anyone? what about the hulk riding a rhinoceros? would you stop him from laughing?
both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. he's just trying to fit in.
chief, i believe i have the answer in the back of my car.
more angry texts from work!
hey, it's called "karma."
you stupid...
hey, guys! whatcha doing in my dream?
you left him because i tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!
well... i didn't really feel like going to moe's today... thought i might hang out here for as long as i can take it.
shut up! shut up! shut up!!!
axels to axels, rust to rust, amen.
ooo, here's one: "happy little elves two: the sequelf." two kids.
well...
i never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
and here's the worst part: i never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- "before you were born" fun.
worthless, worthless, worthless...
can i put my hand through you?
my booze and cologne!
no, this is really good. i...
well, i better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy.
maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories...
game six of the 2011 world series...
...and lenny's story about cancun.
bart! don't call me that!
why you little... they're both bad, and i suspect you know it!
what's wrong with her?
boy, if anyone needs me i'll be taking a popcorn bath. it's a thing i read about in a men's health magazine in a dream.
pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle.
you see? hey, what are you looking at?
observe. hey, it's me again. he's there, isn't he? well, i hope this doesn't sound weird, but i'm inside your closet.
...and five hundred dollars for yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus...
but they're playing the purple sox!
son, you can dial down the crazy. your mother and i talked about it and we found a way to get to new york. it's all set, boy. to save money, we're swapping houses.
you've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. after that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. i'll get us some ice cream.
go where?
boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!
and if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero.
cinnamon!
hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? then today will be nothing but beautiful memories.
when i prayed for this concert to be over, i didn't mean like this!
that was four screams! stupid a.f.i. boy, never go into their director's training program!
now how would you qualify for that?
dogs can't get mumps.
oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy.
o-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... we had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.
he called me... a poser?
prep, prep, prep...
that's short for "rrright you are!"
and then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the santa part.
my dog.
is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?
feed it to the dog.
i made it, kids! i am king of learning-ton castle!
yeah, but i'll go home, weigh myself, and i'll have gained six pounds. what's that about?
i guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
so, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?
fridge-ra-torr!
boy, get in the car. and say goodbye to your best friend forever.
here's something to pass the endless time. write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.
now we're going to leave this place. i'm sorry, bart -- i know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend...
white rice or brown?
we're cool, right boy?
were you worried about me, boy?
clearly the boy's in shock.
stop being blasé!
kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family.
instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living.
thank god i wore the underwear with the hole on the side.
how can something that applies to bart apply to me? i'm so much older and wiser.
hand me my suitcase, boy.
i've told you a thousand times, call me homer!
standard hotel boilerplate. it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
oh, it'll happen again, son.
that's it? well, then let's "power" this party up!
i wrote this song to say i'm sorry
the melody is by beethoven
son, promise you will never look like me.
feather boas?
look at all this wrestling stuff.
i don't know. should i really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
no i don't. if you pray to superman.
funny how the brain does that, huh?
probably one of bart's dirty friends! boy, why are your friends so dirty?
church bulletin? church bulletin? find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. the answer may shock you.
now, for the record, i hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. i never hated the church itself. and now, finally, i believe in something bigger than myself.
day by day... day by day... the deacon's job... is pretty okay... pretty okaaay... i'm going to be a deacon... day by day... i'm already a deacon... day by day...
what the hell is that?
did she really say that?
you like this now? what about "planet jackson and the earth brigade?"
you think we'll last twenty-five years?
they're called "superoos," son. with pictures of the cast of "the expendables".
did you just fart, sir.
hey, oh oh oh! now maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family.
i'm sorry, homer junior. you'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill.
may i ask what this is regarding? oooh, a budding new friendship? oooh! boy, how come you can't get a new friend?
now get up here, boy! we're gonna do the super bowl shuffle.
my name is homer / i'm a real full back / gonna run that ball / don't want no flack...
why you little--
what your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
what your mother is trying to say is--
get real, ding dong! you've already done so much bad stuff, skinner's never going to let you on that boat.
what the?
hello, boy. at times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened...
really? hey, i bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway.
as i always say, don't get mad, get dinner. then get even. with skinner.
yes. what's skinner's weakness?
someday i may have to fake my own death. and maybe you can help me with that.
the secret is don't read the comment cards.
illegally download it? is that legal?
wow, that was easy! all i had to do was click on--
bless you, boy. that was the greatest thing i've seen on a computer that i can talk about with you in the room. how did you know how to do that?
yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to "taken" where the "hangover" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is "fast and furious."
and miss the back half of jimmy kimmel? that's when he experiments, boy.
the rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
all right, son... but you have to pay me back.
do you have my money?
do you have my money?
oh, i know what that means. there comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. finally! i was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler.
more like "at your six-pack," am i right? it's okay if you need to take a little nap.
because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
but it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
at least someone in this family is using them.
uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. you know, dweebler.
uh... c'mon, boy. your job is to guide me.
i mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!
you just wanna see your old man trip and fall! well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--
nobody touch it! bart, stop looking at it!
yes, they sold it to us. so now it's our painting. we can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep.
"you have no obligation to share the money from that painting." ooo, a support rock!
"congratulations on your purchase of a footmaster brand soccer ball." thanks, book!
where's your mother?
give the donuts to the hotel staff. release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild.
why so quiet?
i'm listening. and it better be devastating.
oh my god. that's, that's shattering. and now, i'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since san francisco turned all nerdy.
to drink until there's no pain left in my soul. but first i'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
oh, are the kids with you?
hey, guys! why are you ducked down like that?
do you know how embarrassed i was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?
what is your problem, boy?
wow. i've gotta take that in. while i do, have some bar nuts.
let them ruck the night away!
i just did that because it was a series of funny words!
come on, buddy. just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here.
hey, you know, i don't think this guy likes girls.
beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
you know, pregnant is pregnant...
let them play! we won't look, we'll turn away / go make love, then eat some hay...
roll in hay!
why you little! i'll show you who's a flabbi!
i thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
i told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!
i know how cereal works. now clean your room.
i'm in charge. you do what i say.
you are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. and i'm going to sit right here until you do.
eat your broccoli.
eat your broccoli.
jebus loves tebow.
uh, works for me.
i don't know. eat your broccoli.
we're on an old-time boat!
relation ship. it works two ways. pretty good. pret-ty good.
wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. you're enjoying this, aren't you?
you're my son and you will hate what i hate. angled parking. lemons. kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. and this boat!
are you crazy? we'll never make it! drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
i'm dropping the anchor!
awaiting your orders, mr. midshipman!
oh marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. man, if only you could do that with bart.
keep your pants on, marge. it's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through "book fairs" and "silent auctions." and parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits "reply all" to everything!
hm. that is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
no, boy. i want you to do it.
i'm not screwing you over. no, uh... i'm not screwing you over. i'm not screwing you over.
the eyes in that picture are following me.
a robot with a catchphrase!
okay, so what are you?
why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
prove it. when's your birthday?
you wanna talk about it?
a haircut? let me see!
marge, i have a confession to make about this trip.
you know what? apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. we're gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left.
... ooh!... ...
turn it off!
well, that's it. we've visited every section including churro county, toonton abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? i'll tell you: fun. the kind of fun attractive families have in commercials.
i just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.
'tis a far, far better thing i do than i have ever done before.
and away we go!
the circus? hmmm, i haven't been to the circus since i was a kid.
i know you are but what am i, infinity plus one! jinx!
ask for boogers on bart's half!
i'd be too nervous. have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
...did i say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...
can i play?
today was fun.
i'll eat in bed. not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... oh, and tv would be on. loud.
yeah. thank god that never happened.
d-doo doo doo doo doo! y'know, you're the closest thing i've ever had to a brother.
change back to what?
bloated corpse under the water. i'd say he's been there a few months at least. interesting the way his lips move just like mine. why do you ask?
bye, bart. stay ten forever.
what the? lasagna in bed?!
y'know, i used to have this friend... i told him all my dreams. really, really great kid.
the best. wonder what ever happened to him.
what do you say, boy? wanna split the lasagna?
okay. bart, think of a name. make it great. insanely, unbelievably great!
what are you doing?
gonna be a tight fit.
a what!
yeah. if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.
hey! what's with this?
so, what do you think kids? beauty, isn't it?
i will when mrs. claus's sisters get out of town. thanks for listening, kid.
what's your name, bart... ner? -- er -- little partner?
i'm jolly old saint nick.
nobody knows. it's a secret. i didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on christmas, i'd do anything.
uh-uh.
what! that scrawny little bag of bones?
whoa! ninety-nine times thirteen equals mer-ry christmas!
don't you believe in me, son?
come on, boy. sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.
go! go!
come on, boy.
find any winners, son?
oh, no you don't. no. no. get away from me. uh-uh.
i didn't get my christmas bonus. i tried not to let it ruin christmas for everybody, but no matter what i did, i just couldn't --
get outta here.
wait a minute, you little cheater. you're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.
i'll show you a big dumb balding ape!
how 'bout a tie, son? everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.
the hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
so, how was it?
what?
tell you what: to celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
p.u. when is this over?
sorry, bart. your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some swedish meatball.
well, i guess we don't have to do that.
can it wait, son? it's getting kinda dark.
can you still see the ball, bart?
oh, you don't think so, eh? well, here comes some real heat.
so what was it you wanted to tell me, son?
don't be discouraged, son. i bet einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb.
what is it, son?
what?
why, you little -- !
you can't stay in there forever!
march your butt right out here. now!
but -- son, if you don't come out i can't "hug" you... and "kiss you"... and make you feel all better.
you're right! i'm young, i'm able-bodied, and i'll take anything. watch out, springfield, here i come.
what did you say, son?
our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or i. many of them, incompetent boobs. i know this because i have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. and i say, this stinks!
but, don't worry. i've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!
you were? aw, well go ahead.
where are you, kids?
gotcha!
you remember the rules from last year?
quick, bart, give me a kiss.
no. we're going to say grace first.
look at that, kids! no fighting, no yelling...
now, look, you know and i know this family needs help. professional help. so i made us an appointment with dr. marvin monroe.
good idea.
wait a minute. these mallet things are padded with foam rubber. what's the point?
arrrgh!
oh, yes, doctor.
that piece of junk? forget it! we're going to get a new tv! twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
ah. say no more.
bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.
bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something.
so, what's the problem, son?
the code of the school yard, marge! the rules that teach a boy to be a man. let's see... don't tattle... always make fun of those different from you... never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... hmmm, what else... ?
see, that boy? you didn't expect that, did you? and neither will he.
unfortunately, son, we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
so the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded...
and there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
and if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. that little doozy's been a simpson trademark for generations.
not now, marge.
do you know where my keys are?
come on, come on. let's go.
must you do this every time?
okay. here we go.
what did you do this time, you little hoodlum? oop. get out of the way.
thanks for knowing i mean well.
you're right. bart, vacuum this floor!
oh, no, come on! don't let that boy -- get out of the... oh, no, not again! don't. don't. don't. great, get over. oh, geeze.
what th...
bart, go easy on me. i'm your dad.
oh. me, too.
just try not to kill me too hard, son. heh-heh-heh.
kid, tonight's not your night.
oh! oh! block it.
jealous. everybody ready?
lisa!
yes sir! this is a real adventure. why, i bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this.
well, might be a few. but don't worry about it. if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
and remember not to act afraid. animals can smell fear. and they don't like it. besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.
a rattler!
through here, boy. back to civilization.
bart! oh bart! bart, bart! oh, bart, my beautiful son. why couldn't you have taken me? of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?
what the--? you're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
the first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: conceal your nakedness.
okay, slap a fern on there, boy. now, some mud. there. ooh! that requires a little mollusk. and mollusk for me. all right. we're ready to hit the town.
this young sapling ought to do the trick.
okay, okay. this time i'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him.
no.
honey! honey! we're saved!
wah-neh! wah-neh!
wah neh! wah neh!
nice grizzles. nice grizzles. nice grizzles.
praise the grizzles son.
nice grizzly, nice grizzly.
they've got us cornered, boy. we'll never get away. give me the head.
son, we're in this mess together. no matter how tempting it might be, i can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob.
what! those cute little monkeys? that's terrible. who told you that?
i can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?
i hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
now i've seen everything. black marbleized with a liquid center. the "stealth bowler" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em.
sure, boy. what's on your mind?
i'm glad you asked, son. being popular is the most important thing in the world.
you're not talking about killing anyone, are you?
are you?
ooooh, that's some ball.
just a statue? is the statue of liberty just a statue? is the leaning tower of piza just a statue?
of course i know! sure! you really thought i forgot, didn't you?
for marge?
son, i don't know if i can lift my head, let alone a ball.
oh, sorry... ouch!
i gave you advice? get outta here.
bart! what are you doing?
i'm sorry, i don't usually laugh like this.
your photo?
you see, i'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects.
ahhhhhh!
marge!
i'm gonna miss you, son. and listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. i guess what i'm saying is, don't mess up france the way you messed up your room.
he needs me. hey, boy.
sorry, marge. some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle.
wait a minute. bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
he's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?
okay.
ba, ba / ba ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba...
you know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man.
son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo.
out, boy, out.
ain't that the truth. you know, one time he --
uh... uh... no. are you sure this microphone works? uh, well, i wouldn't say i aided her. this is on, right? because, actually, it was quite a struggle.
eww, i hate that icky soup skin.
i'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. well as long as i'm here, i might as well kill two birds with one stone.
look at those funny little whiskers. oooo! that reminds me. it's big gorilla week on million dollar movie. c'mon boy.
oooh, "gorilla, the conqueror." the granddaddy of them all.
it's so unfair... just because he's different.
hmmmm
we're proud of you boy.
bart, what are you doing?
why you little...
boy must die.
not to worry. i'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
better than your eyes bursting. ewww!
wow!
that should just about do it. man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection...
#name?
come back here now, raven
and some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them.
kids, please leave the room. i don't want you to see this.
bart, would you like to say grace?
you know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.
what's the matter, boy?
hey, burns! hey, "rag arm"!
let's go now... sa-winggg, batter!
well, i'm ready to punch in.
it won't be so bad. you'll die someplace else.
but they didn't care.
"neighbors forever. oh, no! ned flanders."
okay, okay, all right, all right. she's right! let's do something together. what does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
fore!
that was just a practice shot, boy.
luck.
yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
come on, boy.
okay, that didn't work. this time move your head and don't follow through.
what're you doing? that putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. now, c'mon, give your putter a name.
come on, give it a name.
do you wanna try a little harder, son? come on, give it a girl's name.
your putter's name is charlene!
now, this is a picture of your enemy, todd flanders. every day i want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and charlene annihilate him.
look, son, all i'm asking is that you try.
bart! stop fighting with your sister!
bullwinkle.
underdog! don't you know anything?
speaking of heroes, here's mine... tom turkey!
all right, bart that's it! go to your room now!
okay, out you go!
marge, are we ever gonna see him again?
it's your fault i'm bald!
sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
what?
let the destruction begin! hey, they forgot my corn dog.
oh i can't watch.
bart, bart. we're home, son.
ewwww.
amen! well, bart, has dr. hibbert made his point?
you didn't mean that. bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises i don't expect you to keep. if you make this promise, you have to keep it.
springfield gorge? i thought we settled this daredevil junk.
i can and do. go to your room, bart! there, i've done it. i'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.
bart! what are you doing?
you were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?
look, i know i can't stop you. the only thing i can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge.
'cause if you don't, i'll never believe anything you say, ever again.
i mean it, boy.
bart!
boy, i've tried ordering you, i've tried punishing you, and god help me, i even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.
because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
goodbye, son.
ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god.
i didn't know they still made tv dinners this bad.
no, of course you're not going to die. everything's fine!
no!
no, thank you.
you're the doctor!
come on, pal! fugu me!
come here, boy.
nooo, i just want to have a heart-to-heart talk.
you know, bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --
shut up! bart, this is good stuff. i want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. number one, "cover for me." number two, "oh, good idea, boss." number three, "it was like that when i got here."
oh, why you little --
do you two have to sit so close to the tv? back up, or it'll hurt your eyes.
i love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
all right, all right. time for dr. tv to perform a little surgery.
oooo. pro wrestling from mexico. you know, down there it's a real sport.
bart!
the lad has a point.
bart!
bart!
son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. it's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. i want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.
promise me.
marge, we can't be too careful. there are thieves everywhere, and i'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.
bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! now go to your room.
all right, the stuff i stole from work!
bart!
bart!
... and our three children, bart, lisa and maggie.
oh, okay.
what is it, boy?
everybody in the kitchen! we're having a family meeting!
i'm saying...
no.
my god, you're right, marge. you kids wouldn't put me in a home like i did to my dad, would you?
oh, we saw that.
well... sure. we'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. bart!
if i take you, will you two shut up and quit bugging me?
yes!!!
don't you ever do that to me again.
get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
ooh, the glutimus maximizer.
i can't move, boy.
a book made him cry! boo hoo hoo!
wow! you made the front page.
just a popularity contest?! excuse me, what's more important than popularity? now, bart, do you really think you can win?
woo woo! all right! i always knew you had personality. the doctors said it was hyperactivity, but i knew better. president simpson. has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
now, go get 'em.
