dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
mine has a cup holder !
aw thanks , dad .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
dad !
oh , man .

okay , i promise .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
oh , man .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !

i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
amen , brother .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
what an odd thing to say .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .

oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
teamwork is overrated .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
huh ?
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
it ' s your birthday ?
why ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
ay carumba !
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
oops , my homework !
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
again ! again !
huh ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
aw , come on .
cheeky .
well , you told her , dad .
i ' m bart .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
christmas .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
well , no .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
sure you were , rummy .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
ay carumba !

ow ! quit it . it used to be a real boss tattoo .
hey , you guys want a lift in my pedal boat ?

yeah !
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !

well , don ' t buy ' em !
go for it .
we ' re out of waffles .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
yeah .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
we ' re on food stamps ?
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
ay carumba !
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
well , no .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
milhouse abandoned me .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
why ?
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
ow ! !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
okay , i promise .
sure you were , rummy .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
he said what now ?
more like balder and wider .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
foxy boxing ?
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
hey !
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
dad , the plan !
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
yes , sir !
dad ? ! you always hated church !
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
christmas .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
you can ' t make us come down .
where are you really going ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
more like the " expandables " !
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
foxy boxing ?
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
all righty !
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
except a place to live and free food .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
what about my birthday party ?
wow , i never thought of it like that .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
well , yeah , but --
i concur .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
ay carumba !
it ' s a deal .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
well , i wish homer was here .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
tv sucks .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
sure you were , rummy .
work that body , homer .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
so , you fought all those robots ?
it ' s a deal .
okay . rub a dub dub , thanks for the grub .
what ' s your system ?
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
dad , you can ' t eat all those free samples . we ' ve got to get lisa ' s present .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
okay .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
and for the college-bound . . . 000 stay-alert capsules .
look , dad . barber hair .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
aw , man ! we just missed it .
dad , you can ' t eat all those free samples . we ' ve got to get lisa ' s present .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
i ' m going to get the dog back .
uh , nothin ' , pop .
no , wait . i have a plan . but i ' ll need your underpants .
i ' m doing the conan o ' brien show and i wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
come on dad , it ' d be weird .
um , hey , dad , i , i think he wants a . . .
crank it , homer .
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
and we have plenty more on homer simpson .
yes . " do you wet your pants ? " well , even the best of us has an occasional accident .
whoa , it ' s santa , all right ! and he is kickin ' ass !
cool man ! a media circus .
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
yes , sir .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
yes it does .
what did i do ?
oh , how come i never get any mail ?
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
everything .
no i didn ' t , dad .
yeah .
nelson took my lunch money again !
what ?
and he said if we went to the cops , he ' d come back for maggie .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
please dad .
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
dad , you ' re a hero !
we ' re all proud of you , dad .
oh , papa .
what ' s it to ya ?
yeah , this tether has some pluses .
i hear there ' s a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death .
it ' s mergatronic , daddy-ho .
look at me ! i ' m doin ' something !
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
beer ! beer is the cheese . but how to use it . . .
come on , dad , pick up the pace . chew and swallow , no savoring .
they ' d work much better without the padding , doc .
as long as i can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every halloween .
incontinent . . . too rich .
hitler mash-ups .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
you mean the wild mood swings ?
sting !
reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .
one stinkin ' letter ? why ' d you make us gather ' round like that ?
uh-huh .
hey , he didn ' t pay the cover !
aye carumba !
but i want to see it !
read to lisa ? why don ' t you just ask me to kiss her ?
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !
is that true ?
i didn ' t do anything .
we ' re still gonna make it , aren ' t we dad ?
gotta hide .
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
i promise .
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
hey , let ' s get one of those home satellite dishes ! then we can stop suckling on the six-network teat .
that imposter !
what is this crap ? are you wearing a wire ?
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
can i burn evidence in it ?
you can ' t come back later because . . .

i like the beat -- play me the tune .
starting today , we ' re carnies . just like you .
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
all night . you were yelling at the swing .
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
uh , dad , lisa ' s the one you ' re not talking to .
dear lisa . psych . psych , psych , psych . signed , super-psych .
shut up ! shut up !
wow ! can i see your club ?
yeah . he invented stuff , too .
forget about it , homer . you made it to the top . you ' re the coolest dad ever .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
yeah , man .
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
nooooo !
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
what ?
thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
there ' s the rich texan -- and his daughter , paris texan .
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
he ' s damn opposed ! damn ! damn ! damn opposed !
well , time to hit the books .
see ya in the funny pages .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
and ?
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
big deal . i don ' t like girls either .
what the hell are you talkin ' about ? you ' re the one who double dared us .
bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
not bloody likely .
building a soap box derby racer .
thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .

i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
foxy boxing ?
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
well , sure you do .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
but dad . . .
i already do that .
can i ?
yes , sir !
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
uh-oh . school bus .
what if she doesn ' t ?
well , don ' t buy ' em !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
what are you talking about ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
christmas .
i suppose .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
oh , yeah .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
therapy , please .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
. . . dad .
oh , okay .
therapy , please .
we know , dad . we were there .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
perish the thought .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
teamwork is overrated .
well , sure you do .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
should i get my helmet ?
except a place to live and free food .
all right !
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
do shut up ?
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
i want to watch krusty .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
you could be my father figure .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
no , we need to sail !
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
hey , check it out !
hey , check it out !
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
wait , dad , look !
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
what the ?
dad , it-it ' s me !
amen .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
should i get my helmet ?
oh , man .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
we ' re on food stamps ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
dad !
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
amen .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
next .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
so what if i am ?
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
what an odd thing to say .
yeah .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i guess it ' s possible .
what did i do ?
wow , look at all this loot ! what should we buy first ?
uh , dad . . .
well , actually . . . i may have accidentally traded a few of those pills , for money . . .
no , not really .
look , he thinks he ' s people .
yeah !
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
i got suspended from school today .
. . . but let ' s see what you know about super-heroes .
no sir , i didn ' t .
who ' s the black private dick that ' s the sex machine to all the chicks ?
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
hey lame ass . thanks to you , we ' re stuck on a stupid therapy boat .
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
what time ?
dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
ow .
i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
yeah !
so ?
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .
not to mention hilarious .
dad ?
this squishee is awful !
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
you had your hot dog plumped ?
sounds like something you ' d say .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
ah , dad , if just me , milhouse and lewis had voted . . .
hey , look what i found !
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
praise the lord .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
in the cart .
oh , no .
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
big if !
dad . . . i couldn ' t stay with mom and lisa while you were out here .
c ' mon , dad ! the team ' s arriving !
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
i ' ll save you !
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
i hear there ' s a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death .
i did .
is that true ?
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
oh , i don ' t get a song ? mom got a song .
no , i mean the mailman ' s here .
hey , there ' s a bug that looks like dad . let ' s kill it .
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
yeah , man .
incontinent . . . too rich .
ow ! quit it . it used to be a real boss tattoo .
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
wow , you can do anything out here .
so ?
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
okay .
hello , sir .

locusts . they ' ll drive him nuts .
but dad , my heart hurts .
let ' s get this show on the road , man . we got things to do .
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
we ' re all proud of you , dad .
i ' m on it .
yes , sir .
stop it !
you ' re not welcome .
so ?
hey ! / ay carumba !
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
yes . " do you wet your pants ? " well , even the best of us has an occasional accident .
da-ad --
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
you didn ' t do anything .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
you didn ' t do anything .
what are you doing ?
hurry up , dad !
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger .
well , dad , here ' s my report card . i think you ' ll be pleasantly surprised .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
uh , right . do you know what a wet willie is ?
uh-huh . bet he used bait , too .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
what ' s it to ya ?
huh ?
after dinner , can i watch cartoons ?
gimme ! i want more !
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
oh , i thought i ' d check out the warner brothers network .
well his parents aren ' t married , are they ? it ' s the correct word , isn ' t it ?
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
hell no .
it ' s mergatronic , daddy-ho .
wow . so that ' s how lisa got her sax .
dad ?
no .
it ' s on the back of our vests .
permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
hey mom , can i have some money to buy dad a present ?
beep .
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
lisa ! dad ! c ' mere quick ! there is something that you won ' t believe !
hitler mash-ups .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
if edison thought of that chair , how come it ' s not on this chart ?
wow ! we all have the same scar !
no .
a real preacher knows how to bring the bible alive through music and dancing and tae-bo !
dad , don ' t be a credit hog
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
hey ! thanks , monkey-man .
oh , right . what ' d you get her , dad ?
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
not bloody likely .
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
whoa !
dad , you ' re eating dr . phil !
yeah , mom says a lot of things .
hey dad , can we play ?
uh , right . do you know what a wet willie is ?
dad ?
how much ?
what a sap !
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
you ' re the man , homer .
good afternoon .
i ' m gonna put my trophy on the mantle . how ' bout you ?
well , it used to be .
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
dad , thanks to television , i can ' t remember what happened eight minutes ago .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself .
hey , you guys want a lift in my pedal boat ?
gimme ! i want more !
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .
beer ! beer is the cheese . but how to use it . . .
big if !
everything .
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !
trick-or-treat ! lick my feet ! your head smells like pig-butt meat !
are you guys fighting over us ?
hello ?
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
da-ad --
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
homer !
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
sting !
dad , you can ' t eat all those free samples . we ' ve got to get lisa ' s present .
well , dad , here ' s my report card . i think you ' ll be pleasantly surprised .
and he taught me how to do this .
no time .
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
not to mention hilarious .
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
so what ' s our first job , huh ? test the roller coaster ?
good for you . no more drinkin ' ?
yes . " do you wet your pants ? " well , even the best of us has an occasional accident .
who ' s the black private dick that ' s the sex machine to all the chicks ?
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
nuh-uh , ' cause we called it .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
dad , thanks to television , i can ' t remember what happened eight minutes ago .
dad , look who ' s in there !
they ' re not mine . my boss said his warehouse was full .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
what time ?
you ' ll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
the flanders are a buncha geeks , man .
homer . nyahhh .
oh , please ! this is senseless destruction , with none of my usual social commentary .
take him away , boys .
uh , i learned the touch of death .
eh .
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
dad , the bill ' s only a hundred .
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
today we learned how to rip a man ' s heart out and show it to him before he dies .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
i promise .
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
she just found out no one likes her . i thought she knew !
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
but dad , my heart hurts .
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
they have it now .
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !
dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
i don ' t know , dad . what if she ' s still mad at me ?
i did .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
she should be back now . it ' s dinner time .
see ya in the funny pages .
okay , okay .
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
oh , you mean krusty the clown ?
i ' ll get to it when i get to it .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
what ' s his problem ?
yeah , thanks a lot , flanders .
aren ' t we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
the secret ingredient is blood .
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "
ready . set . hut , hut !
i sure hope not .
not bloody likely .
she said " yes . "
whoa ! they like each other !
buh .
cowabunga one to fat load .
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
what happened to you , man ? you used to be cool .
but dad . . .
dad , it-it ' s me !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
go for it .
can i have a beer ?
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
you c ' mere a minute .
yeah !
nice try , homer .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
i want to watch krusty .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
right .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
okay .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
okay , i promise .
don ' t give up , dad .
i guess it ' s possible .
what a dump !
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
now that ' s a broken man .
oh , it will not .
now !
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
well , i wish homer was here .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
fresh out .
cheeky .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
what an odd thing to say .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
busted !
well , you told her , dad .
can i have a beer ?
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
dad ? ! you always hated church !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
um hm .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
but she might say no .
amen .
can i ?
no reason . brother .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
you mean i can go ?
i need this candy for school .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
perish the thought .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
yes , sir .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
but i don ' t hate this country .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
what if she doesn ' t ?
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
yes , sir !
mine has a cup holder !
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
yuk !
should i get my helmet ?
what are you talking about ?
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
hey !
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
look , that ' s our ship !
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
but she might say no .
that movie ' s for babies .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
milhouse abandoned me .
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .
what about the people on the bottom ?
hey paris , i saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet . . . your face !
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
excellent .

thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?
buh .
no , dad , he ' s my friend !
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
and it ' s on this dvd !
that imposter !
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
you ' re dead , squealer .
well , just this week , there ' s been field day , picking me up from the airport . . .

a real preacher knows how to bring the bible alive through music and dancing and tae-bo !
yes sir .
locusts . they ' ll drive him nuts .
i ' m going to get the dog back .
no , sir .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
they ' d work much better without the padding , doc .
uh , dad ? laddie ' s not coming . i gave him away .
very nice .
hey dad , can we play ?

hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
why are we still grifting ? the car ' s paid for . doesn ' t that balance out the universe ?
dad . . .

bart simpson , at your service .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !

amen .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
what if she doesn ' t ?

final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .

so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
yeah !
why don ' t you buy it ?
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
then what was in the coffin ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
but i thought you loved edison .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
well , you told her , dad .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
how do you know ?
where are you going ?
what about adultery ?
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
i guess it ' s possible .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .

hey , check it out !
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
i ' m under thirty .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
i didn ' t take it .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
wow ! a big ugly head !
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
dad , the plan !
more like the " expandables " !
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
fat guy number three ?
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
work that body , homer .
homer , you ate their jerky .
slurp my snot .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
huh ?
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
but she might say no .
wait , dad , look !
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
thanks , dad .
teamwork is overrated .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
again ! again !
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
you mean i can go ?
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
what do you think ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
so , you fought all those robots ?
i didn ' t take it .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
all righty !
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
dad !
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
fresh out .
i suppose .
testify !
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
teamwork is overrated .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
thanks , pop .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
you ' re the boss .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
and how .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
nice try , homer .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
now !
you mean i can go ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
then what was in the coffin ?
i ' m under thirty .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
thanks , dad .
yuk !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .

dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
what about my birthday party ?
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
okay , i promise .
i understand why . you were wasted .
where are you really going ?
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
fresh out .

uh-oh . school bus .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .

more like the " expandables " !
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
therapy , please .
but she might say no .
it ' s gone .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .

hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
but dad . . .
dad , how drunk are you ?

the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
agreed .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
now that ' s a broken man .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
what about my birthday party ?
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
homer , you ate their jerky .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
cool !

i was faking it .
fresh out .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
put it in the bank .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !

fresh out .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .

you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .

i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .

teamwork is overrated .
it ' s your birthday ?
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
well , i wish homer was here .

wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .

c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
your electric hammer , maestro ?

i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
fresh out .

sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .

teamwork is overrated .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
what if she doesn ' t ?
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
what about my birthday party ?
i already do that .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
yes , sir .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
why would i want a nap ?

oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .

dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .

an elephant ' s butt ?
ay carumba !

not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
oh , yeah .
an elephant ' s butt ?
okay .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
the fat guy on tv ?
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?

ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
can i have a beer ?
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .

how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
yeah , their guns are right there !
mount kilimanjaro ?
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
we know , dad . we were there .
i can help you .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
slurp my snot .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
you have a drinking problem ?
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
choose your corncob ! en garde !
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?

no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
dad !
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
dad , it-it ' s me !
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
amen .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .

yes , sir .
what if she doesn ' t ?
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
i could take up smoking .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
what ? no !
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .

and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
fat guy number three ?

this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .

wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .

how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
what ? no !
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
but i thought uter took my place .

i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
slurp my snot .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
we ' re out of waffles .
what if someone catches him ?
foxy boxing ?
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .

but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
what ?
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
where did the ship stop again ?
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !

toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
hey , that ' s my washcloth .

are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
foxy boxing ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .

what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
yeah .

i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
i ' ll supervise .
but she might say no .

slurp my snot .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .

c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .

dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .

what are you doing ?
dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .

if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
what a sap !
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
what time ?
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .
dad ?
it ' s mergatronic , daddy-ho .
and he taught me how to do this .
how much ?
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
it doesn ' t sound very tractor-y .
dad . . . i need help . . . please . . .
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass ?
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !

you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
is uncle fester still alive ?
i don ' t know . . . fleecin ' old people ?
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .

well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
i love you , dad .
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .

he ' s trained to do all sorts of stuff . he can herd sheep and perform cpr .
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
are you kidding ? he ' s my idol . i ' ve based my whole life on krusty ' s teachings .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
i like the beat -- play me the tune .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
he was driving me crazy so i sent him on an errand .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
thanks , dad .
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
yeah .
what ?
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
hey , look what i found !
heeere ' s bart !
hey , that ' s my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated , eight-fold , fourteen-gauge box .
so you and mom aren ' t married ? does that mean i ' m a bastard ?
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
are you guys fighting over us ?
buh .
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
oh , how come i never get any mail ?
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
you ' re dead , squealer .
i sure hope not .

why didn ' t you wait for me ?
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
what about what i want ? i ' d help you take care of him .
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .

you can ' t come back later because . . .
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
but i want to see it !
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .

you think you ' re better than the great simpsini ? !
wait , is the hulk laughing , or the rhinoceros ?
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
anything ' s better than that dump we came from .
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
uh , right . do you know what a wet willie is ?
i can ' t take it anymore ! every time i try to relax , she-- ow , my neck !
i ' m sorry .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .
you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
who ' s gonna eat my homework now ?
there ' s the rich texan -- and his daughter , paris texan .
there you go . . thanks for comin ' out . . .
hey , homer , i found your weights .

dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?

i didn ' t take it .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .

thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
fresh out .
that movie ' s for babies .

dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?

before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
okay , i promise .

you mean like we just did ?
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
cheeky .
i understand why . you were wasted .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
cool man !
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .

why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
you can always find your favorite shows next month .
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
hey ! thanks , monkey-man .
why didn ' t you wait for me ?
i liked it when it was me , mom and homer . you wrecked everything . i ' m leaving . goodbye .
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
dad , no !
incontinent . . . too rich .
thanks , dad .
yes . " are you quick to anger ? "
dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--

monsters ! monsters ! monsters !
anything ' s better than that dump we came from .
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
yeah , and a good dad wouldn ' t miss his son ' s little league games !
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .
hey , man , i didn ' t do anything wrong .
hey , dad , look what i got ! zzzapp ! ! zzzapp ! zzzapp ! zzzapp !
trade you my next turn for your dessert .

gross ! weird ! complicated ! go to sleep !
maybe laura could watch us .
it ' s on the back of our vests .
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?

we said " meh . "
dad . . .
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
have you been " oh boy " -ing all night ?

oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
what about adultery ?
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
oh , yeah .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
hey , i call first bedsies !
dad , you barely go to work at all .
it ' s goose !
christmas .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
look , that ' s our ship !

lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
who are you talking to , homer ?
where did the ship stop again ?
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
you mean more popular but not as good ?

amen .
um hm .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
we are home .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
why ?
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !

i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .

let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .

because we ' re poor ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
right , dad .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
mount kilimanjaro ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
don ' t give up , dad .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
what if someone catches him ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
does something smell funny in here ?
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
choose your corncob ! en garde !
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
well , yeah , but --
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
dad !
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
more like balder and wider .
it ' s your birthday ?
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
dad , the plan !
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
what ? no !
teamwork is overrated .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
krusty !
i ' m bart .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
i guess it ' s possible .
there you go , ratboy .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
you mean i can go ?
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
hullo ?
well , i wish homer was here .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
what about abraham lincoln ?
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
um hm .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
more like the " expandables " !
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
aw , come on .
where are you going ?
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
nice try , homer .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
you have a drinking problem ?
dad ? ! you always hated church !
um hm .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
can i ask you something , dad ?
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
uh-oh . school bus .
all righty !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
because we ' re poor ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
well , no .
hullo ?
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
well , i wish homer was here .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
gotcha . well , gotta go .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
do shut up ?
more like the " expandables " !
but she might say no .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
we ' re on food stamps ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
mine has a cup holder !
where did the ship stop again ?
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
did you check your pocket ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
no me gusto . que lastima .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
huh ?
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
tv sucks .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
no reason . brother .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
dad !
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
it ' s goose !
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
again ! again !
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
amen .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
paw !
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
amen .
amen , brother .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
bart simpson , at your service .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
cool man !
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
company physical coming up , huh ?
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
because we ' re poor ?
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
oh , man .
you could be my father figure .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
i thought it was chocolate milk !
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
no , we need to sail !
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
we ' re out of waffles .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
what ?
amen .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
okay , i ' m sold .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
mom . get him away from the window .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
dad !
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
why would i want a nap ?
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
tell it , daddy !
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
i already do that .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
i need this candy for school .
eh , we could try it .
mount kilimanjaro ?
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
what if she doesn ' t ?
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
what do you think ?
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
you mean like we just did ?
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
you can ' t make us come down .
why would i want a nap ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
fresh out .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
what if she doesn ' t ?
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
more like the " expandables " !
choose your corncob ! en garde !
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
can i ask you something , dad ?
tv sucks .
uh-oh . school bus .
i guess it ' s possible .
our book ! the real one !
but i thought you loved edison .
okay , i ' m sold .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
milhouse abandoned me .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
well , don ' t buy ' em !
nice try , homer .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
right , dad .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
what ?
here ' s fifty .
the lady said no .
then why no pictures ?
cut it out !
no .
yeah !
sucker .
and our portable tv !
please dad .
bastard / bastard , bastard !
bitchin ' !
that is so cool !
uh , nothing .
dad , maybe you should do this .
i won ! i won !
kbbl is gonna give me something stupid !
mr . plow !
no , play !
mo-om !
mr . plow !
oh , look at their guts .
no .
who the hell are you ?
but , da--
homer .
hello , lisa .
dad , are you hurt ?
hello , lisa .
oh , look at their guts .
polo !
hey , lis .

wow !

i was thinking more of the deep fryer .

i can help you .
i already do that .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .

this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
look , that ' s our ship !
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .

no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?

the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
i thought it was chocolate milk !

mount kilimanjaro ?
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
thanks , dad .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .

hey , dad . are we going camping ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
mom . get him away from the window .
nice try , homer .
right , dad .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
you could be my father figure .
how do you know ?
tv sucks .

i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
what do you think ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
cool !
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
you think so ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
what about sunday ?
really , dad ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

dad , it-it ' s me !
tv sucks .
there ' s no denying it , sis .

hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !

yeah !
that movie ' s for babies .
mom , is that true ?
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .

we know , dad . we were there .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
i thought it was chocolate milk !
can i ask you something , dad ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .

hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
yes , sir .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
ay carumba !
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
aw , come on .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
it ' s gone .
perish the thought .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
because we ' re poor ?
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
i concur .
hey , everybody . look what we got !

ow ! !
oh , man .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
paw !
should i get my helmet ?
cheeky .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
sure , why not ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
what do you think ?
why the hell would i want to see that ?
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
why don ' t you buy it ?
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
hurry , homer !
anything slim !
dad !
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .

cheeky .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
hey , what smells so good ?
i need this candy for school .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
choose your corncob ! en garde !
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
dad , how drunk are you ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
well , no .
oh , yeah .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
i could take up smoking .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .

bart simpson , at your service .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
amen , brother .

oh , okay .
i ' m gonna put my trophy on the mantle . how ' bout you ?
with a virgin tom collins for me ?
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
wait , i know . beer here !
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
think about it . i mean , what " team " was babe ruth on ? who knows ?
we never had a family meeting before .

hurry up , dad !
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .

oh yeah , safety sells . especially to lame-o ' s .
i ' m doing the conan o ' brien show and i wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about .
well . . . maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
i don ' t love you either . so give me a moped .
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
gotcha .
i sure hope not .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
hey ! / ay carumba !
dad , you gotta come . i just got your hat out of the fridge .
nelson took my lunch money again !

dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
we don ' t need dental floss either , mom .
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
and ?
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
thanks , dad . sure you ' re not gonna be bored ?
oh , you mean krusty the clown ?

dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
why would duff beer put out a book ?
yee-hawww !
lisa , do you really need all these kurt vonnegut novels ?
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
dad , don ' t be a credit hog
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .
buh .
hey , homer , you promised mom you wouldn ' t wear your dress outside .
i will , dad .

dad , over here !
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
wow , you can do anything out here .
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
um , i ' ve gotta make a phone call .
aww . and someday you ' ll be one too .
wait a minute . they ' re not so great .
oh no . you ' re in texas !
she makes me taste beer .
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
hey , what gives ?
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
and who ' s your little school friend ? wait a minute , that ' s mom !
ashes to ashes . . . dust to dust . . . we ' ve gotta go fight some robots .
all right , dad , you ' ve been warned . let ' s go .
i can ' t take it anymore ! every time i try to relax , she-- ow , my neck !
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
big deal . i don ' t like girls either .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
as much as i hate that man right now , you gotta love that suit .

mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !

dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
mount kilimanjaro ?
does something smell funny in here ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
there you go , ratboy .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !

hey , i call first bedsies !
yes , sir .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
dad , the mailman is here .
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !

bart simpson , at your service .

the nineties ? never heard of it .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
i suppose .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .

dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
amen .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
next .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
paw !
i understand why . you were wasted .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
cheeky .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
amen .
look , that ' s our ship !
hey , look , another spaceship !
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
hey , check it out !
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .

but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .

yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
hey , everybody . look what we got !
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !

i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
you mean like we just did ?
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
company physical coming up , huh ?
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
why ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
why don ' t you buy it ?

dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .

i can help you .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .

where are you going ?
except a place to live and free food .
we ' re on food stamps ?
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
dad ? ! you always hated church !
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
eh , we could try it .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
you can ' t make us come down .
but i don ' t hate this country .

goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
i guess it ' s possible .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
what an odd thing to say .
but dad . . .
can i have a beer ?
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
but i don ' t hate this country .
right , dad .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
what about abraham lincoln ?
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
you have a drinking problem ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
no .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?

i love you , dad .
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
stupid kid . do you really think that ' s the way we should communicate ?
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .

all right , the personals ! hmm . hm-hm-hm . " successful mayor-type seeks open-minded , discreet cheerleader-type . "
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .

i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
yeah .
take him away , boys .
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
my ex-girlfriends .
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
gimme a " b " ?
they ' re not mine . my boss said his warehouse was full .
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
quick gramma , hide !
he was driving me crazy so i sent him on an errand .
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .

oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
ow ! you stepped on my arm !
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
you can always find your favorite shows next month .
no .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
aren ' t we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?
all night . you were yelling at the swing .
um , hey , dad , i , i think he wants a . . .
hey ! thanks , monkey-man .
here you go . enjoy .
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?
y ' see ? this is the stuff mom won ' t do with me .
lis , skinner is using you . like a pawn on his unholy chess set .
okay , okay .
can we say it ' s my birthday and get free stuff ?
you threw it , you go find it .
who ' s gonna eat my homework now ?
what ' s wrong ?
no time .
monsters ! monsters ! monsters !
will i ever play baseball again ?
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
see ya in the funny pages .
hey , dad . i ' m gonna make a human yo-yo . if you object , clearly say " no " .
these games are so old . who got these high scores ? pilgrims ? hmm , never saw this one before .
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
no .
what ' s a chachi ?
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
no , look ! it ' s a ride that just opened and no one ' s there !
but dad , my heart hurts .
gay out ?
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
hey , what gives ?
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
they have it now .
dad ?
d ' unno . why are your friends such drunks ?
maybe .
yay !
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
what happened to you , man ? you used to be cool .
waaaaaaaah !
why are we still grifting ? the car ' s paid for . doesn ' t that balance out the universe ?
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
i ' m bart simpson . who the hell are you ?
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
no .
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .
i ' m under thirty .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
you could be my father figure .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
i already do that .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
aw thanks , dad .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
where did the ship stop again ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
christmas .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
we know , dad . we were there .
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
a real swiss army knife . cool !
does something smell funny in here ?
the nineties ? never heard of it .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
aw , dad .
yes , sir .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
what an odd thing to say .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
what the ?
what if she doesn ' t ?
did you check your pocket ?
you c ' mere a minute .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
but dad . . .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
amen .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
he said what now ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
nice try , homer .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
so what if i am ?
it ' s gone .
homer !
don ' t give up , dad .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
teamwork is overrated .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
tell it , daddy !
i thought it was chocolate milk !
okay , i promise .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
how do you know ?
huh ?
can i ?
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
where are you really going ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
um hm .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
what are you talking about ?
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
so , you fought all those robots ?
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
dad , how drunk are you ?
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
eh , we could try it .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
yes , sir .
mom . get him away from the window .
ay carumba !
i understand why . you were wasted .
but dad . . .
i already do that .
does something smell funny in here ?
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
fresh out .
why would i want a nap ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
hey , what smells so good ?
wow , i never thought of it like that .
hullo ?
what if someone catches him ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
hey , look , another spaceship !
can i ask you something , dad ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
there you go , ratboy .
christmas .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
not so tough now , huh ?
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
oh , okay .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
no reason . brother .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i can help you .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
yeah !
he said what now ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
ay carumba !
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
not so tough now , huh ?
what if someone catches him ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
so what if i am ?
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
fresh out .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
you mean i can go ?
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
slurp my snot .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
huh ?
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
ay carumba !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
does something smell funny in here ?
yeah .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
now fly -- to the canary islands !
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
oh , man .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
our book ! the real one !
who are you talking to , homer ?
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
mount kilimanjaro ?
thanks , dad .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
ay carumba !
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
hey , what smells so good ?
no .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
so , you fought all those robots ?
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
now !
okay .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
company physical coming up , huh ?
where did the ship stop again ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
aw thanks , dad .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
cheeky .
dad !
/ get your hands off of me , you fat ass--
and we have plenty more on homer simpson .
i will , dad .
unky herb , what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself ?
i ' m trying , dad .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
well , maybe i should .
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
we know you ' re innocent , dad .
outtasight ! lay it on me , mama .
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
all right , the personals ! hmm . hm-hm-hm . " successful mayor-type seeks open-minded , discreet cheerleader-type . "
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
all right , dad , you ' ve been warned . let ' s go .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
you threw it , you go find it .
we ' re all proud of you , dad .
hurry up , dad !
yeah .
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
no , not really .
i did .
yeah ! let ' s go skiing ! / yeah , dad . let ' s go !
yeah , you know her .
i don ' t want to take drugs .
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
what are you planting ?
yikes ! what is that ?
it hurts when i swallow .
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
no , i got hit by a couple of cars . i won ' t be able to play today .
dad , thanks to television , i can ' t remember what happened eight minutes ago .
homer .
oh , yeah .
my ex-girlfriends .
hey , dad , look what i got ! zzzapp ! ! zzzapp ! zzzapp ! zzzapp !
i ' ll get back to you .
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
thanks , dad .
hey , dad , look what i got ! zzzapp ! ! zzzapp ! zzzapp ! zzzapp !
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
he certainly has , dad . i learned a real lesson here today . thank you . dr . hibbert .
i ' m sorry .
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
horrifying .
no ! stop the hovering !
dear lisa . psych . psych , psych , psych . signed , super-psych .
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
we ' re still gonna make it , aren ' t we dad ?
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .
dad , do you wear boxers or briefs ?
the last place i saw it . . .
his house ?
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
you are fully bonded and licensed by the city , aren ' t you mr . plow ?
uh , he didn ' t say science . . . he said " pie pants . "
now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it .
is uncle fester still alive ?
she should be back now . it ' s dinner time .
homer ?
fine . take it .
yeah , and a good dad wouldn ' t miss his son ' s little league games !
don ' t worry , i don ' t even like using the bathroom after you .
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
hell , yes .
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
whoa ! yeah , strike three ! you ' re outta there .
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .
what a sap !
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
lisa has a big toy ! no fair ! that means i get two small toys !
no , i mean teacher .
she said " yes . "
policeman .
yeah .
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
what did i do ?
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
okay .
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
how could you have it planned out ? you just heard about the problem .
oh !
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .
and it ' s on this dvd !
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
maybe .
really ? ! oh , how terrible !
wow , dad . you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl ?
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
mom ! dad ! i saw sideshow bob and he threatened to kill me !
i liked it when it was me , mom and homer . you wrecked everything . i ' m leaving . goodbye .
makes sense to me .
you got it .
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .
oh , papa .

we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
balloon ride , wax museum , the denzel washington monument , colonial phoenix , hey , dude ranch !

hey dad , can we play ?
hey , dad . . . what if we . . .

what ' d you do with all the loot ?
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
no , dad , they ' re the opposite .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
hey homer , you gonna kiss him or kill him ?
ow . ow . ow . ow . ow . ow .
cool ! way to adapt , little guy .
how ' d you know that thing would work ?

i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
what are you doing ?
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
well , actually . . . i may have accidentally traded a few of those pills , for money . . .
all right , you ' re not a flabbi ! okay ! i got it !
but wouldn ' t that make us con artists ?
i ' ll get back to you .
so , i suppose that ' s a hillbilly jacuzzi ?
oh , papa .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
lisa has a big toy ! no fair ! that means i get two small toys !
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
pay the man , homer .
maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
no , dad , he ' s my friend !
oh , can we keep him dad , please ?
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .
squawky ?
her pillow ' s stuck .
thanks , dad .
hey , he didn ' t pay the cover !
dad ? it says " non-toxic . "
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
my ex-girlfriends .
she should be back now . it ' s dinner time .
oh , you mean krusty the clown ?
oh man , now she ' s writing cutesy things with the ribbon .
yes !
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
hello ?
no belching .
i ' ll save you !
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
i got my tenure right here .
says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring .
dad , only one of them is real .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
he looks happy .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
take him away , boys .
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
gross ! weird ! complicated ! go to sleep !
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
i believe you , dad .
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
thanks , dad . sure you ' re not gonna be bored ?
oh !
chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
yes sir !
thanks dad .
yeah , man .
dad , thanks to television , i can ' t remember what happened eight minutes ago .
dad , look at me ! look at me !
here you go , dad . i hope you like it . i ' ve forgotten what it is .
now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it .
where do the people sit ?
thanks , dad .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
aren ' t those full of germs ?
you are .
in the cart .
yeah , you know her .
this is so humiliating .
praise the lord .
huh ?
oh , dad , you are the living end .
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
no , wait . i have a plan . but i ' ll need your underpants .
wowww ! !
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
they took the bait . let ' s go .
wow . so that ' s how lisa got her sax .
spuckler mary , please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance . . .
and ?
i ' ll have one drink , one cocktail and one booze , please .
lisa has a big toy ! no fair ! that means i get two small toys !
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
i don ' t know . . . fleecin ' old people ?
you threw it , you go find it .
i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .
come on , dad . didn ' t you ever do anything wild when you were a kid ?
how could you have it planned out ? you just heard about the problem .
our teacher .
ow ! quit it . it used to be a real boss tattoo .
yeah . he invented stuff , too .
don ' t you mean present ?
yeah , why aren ' t we doing lenny ' s story ? that thing ' s hilarious .
really ?
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
nice use of the lingo , homer .
dad , don ' t be a credit hog
i will , dad .
reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
just some report i gotta do for school . hey , you want some pie ?
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
really ?
now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it .
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !
if edison thought of that chair , how come it ' s not on this chart ?
hm . " thanks for letting us crash in your pad . we had a very nice time . "
they ' ll buy anything !
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
eh , we could try it .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
what about my birthday party ?
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
hit the road , " welcome home . "
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
aw , come on .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
that movie ' s for babies .
paw !
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
christmas .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
right , dad .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
what the ?
gotcha . well , gotta go .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
can i stay with you , dad ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
you can ' t make us come down .
what a dump !
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
where did the ship stop again ?
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
but i thought you loved edison .
dad , the plan !
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
you have a drinking problem ?
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
why don ' t you buy it ?
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
yuk !
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
can i ask you something , dad ?
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
anything slim !
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
cheeky .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
ay carumba !
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
it ' s gone .
what the ?
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
what do you think ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
hullo ?
the nineties ? never heard of it .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
where are you going ?
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
what about my birthday party ?
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
but i thought you loved edison .
right .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
wait , dad , look !
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
wait , dad , look !
can i stay with you , dad ?
go for it .
wait , dad , look !
hey !
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
now !
i can help you .
krusty !
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
what if someone catches him ?
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
yuk !
cool !
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
does something smell funny in here ?
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
but i thought you loved edison .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
you could be my father figure .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
wow ! a big ugly head !
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
it ' s your birthday ?
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
yeah .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
right , dad .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
right , dad .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
what if she doesn ' t ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
no , we need to sail !
tv sucks .
but i thought you loved edison .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
hey , everybody . look what we got !
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "

mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
i could take up smoking .
huh ?
bart simpson , at your service .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
all righty !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
why don ' t you buy it ?
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
mom . get him away from the window .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
ay carumba !
what if someone catches him ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
um hm .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
an elephant ' s butt ?
yuk !
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
okay , i ' m sold .

oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
no .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
okay , i ' m sold .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
mom .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
what happened ?
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
what about adultery ?
milhouse abandoned me .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
right , dad .
paw !
but i thought you loved edison .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .

i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .

i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
more like balder and wider .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
oh , man .
cheeky .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .

listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
therapy , please .
it ' s gone .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
i thought you wanted me to drum !
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
mount kilimanjaro ?
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i want to watch krusty .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
right , dad .

no me gusto . que lastima .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
dad , you barely go to work at all .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
yeah .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
amen , brother .

you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !

toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .

you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
gotcha . well , gotta go .
i concur .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
well , yeah , but --
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
there you go , ratboy .
but dad . . .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .

dad , the mailman is here .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
tv sucks .

who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?

hey , what gives ?
does anyone here like food ?

a zephyr ?
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
hurry up , dad !
dad , you can ' t let him take our dog !

no , sir .
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?
with a virgin tom collins for me ?
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger .
spuckler mary , please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance . . .

hey , you guys want a lift in my pedal boat ?
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .

all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
oh how do i know this isn ' t some beautiful dream , too ?
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
dad , l . t . ' s gone crazy !
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
excellent .
so are we going to the lake or what ?

i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
nelson ' s a great quarterback . he ' s carryin ' this team !
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !

it ' s a deal .
we ' re out of waffles .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .

i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
except a place to live and free food .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
what about my birthday party ?
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
yeah !
. . . dad .
teamwork is overrated .
why would i want a nap ?
the fat guy on tv ?
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
hey , look , another spaceship !
oh , man .
you ' re the boss .
i can help you .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .

lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .

look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
except a place to live and free food .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
mom , is that true ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
dad , how drunk are you ?
except a place to live and free food .
oh , okay .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
you c ' mere a minute .
no , we need to sail !
eh , we could try it .
you think so ?
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
what ? no !
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
what about adultery ?
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
teamwork is overrated .
tv sucks .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
the fat guy on tv ?
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
we ' re out of waffles .
you mean i can go ?
what the ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
now that ' s a broken man .
fat guy number three ?
hit the road , " welcome home . "
foxy boxing ?
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
all righty !
we ' ve seen it , dad .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
more like balder and wider .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
huh ?
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
what happened ?
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
our book ! the real one !
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
well , sure you do .
work that body , homer .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
so , you fought all those robots ?
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
dad ?
hey , homer , you promised mom you wouldn ' t wear your dress outside .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
no time .

dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
hey , you guys want a lift in my pedal boat ?
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?
yeah , dad ! you ' re a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .

dad , i ' ll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol ' danish .
yeah . there ' s just no way to resist it , is there ?
in the cart .
i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
put him down , boy ! put him down !
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .
why are we still grifting ? the car ' s paid for . doesn ' t that balance out the universe ?
he smells worse than anything ! hey , you ! elephant ! lift me up on your back , man .
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
you ' re not welcome .
throw hot wax on him , dad !
no sir , i didn ' t .

i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .

indeed i did .
his house ?
just some report i gotta do for school . hey , you want some pie ?
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?

oh !
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !
i did .
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .
have you been " oh boy " -ing all night ?
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
yeah , man .
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
we never had a family meeting before .
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
all right , you ' re not a flabbi ! okay ! i got it !
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .
oh , i don ' t get a song ? mom got a song .

now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
yikes ! what is that ?
wow , look at all this loot ! what should we buy first ?
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
no time .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
way to go , dad !
hm . " thanks for letting us crash in your pad . we had a very nice time . "
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
every day , same old cat . i ' ll make him more interesting .
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
he smells worse than anything ! hey , you ! elephant ! lift me up on your back , man .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
yeah , man .
wow ! can i see your club ?
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
all right , you ' re not a flabbi ! okay ! i got it !
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
whatcha doin ' , mom ? goin ' crazy ?
he did ?
you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
the store detective !
whoa careful , dad . blow a gasket and you lose your job .
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .

i have a question .
homer . nyahhh .
come on , dad . didn ' t you ever do anything wild when you were a kid ?
i love you , dad .
. . . but let ' s see what you know about super-heroes .
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
i didn ' t do anything .
no , wait . i have a plan . but i ' ll need your underpants .

shaddap !
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .

incontinent . . . too rich .
as much as i hate that man right now , you gotta love that suit .

go ! go ! go ! now ' s your chance !
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
i ' ve got a partner .

remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
what ? why ?
crank it , homer .
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?
he smells worse than anything ! hey , you ! elephant ! lift me up on your back , man .

uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
no .
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
thanks dad .

but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
dad , the car !
aw , that ' s my krusty . i got a feeling he ' ll be allll-right .
oh how do i know this isn ' t some beautiful dream , too ?
hey , he didn ' t pay the cover !
froggie , i ' m home .

fine .
today we learned how to rip a man ' s heart out and show it to him before he dies .
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
get lost .
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
balloon ride , wax museum , the denzel washington monument , colonial phoenix , hey , dude ranch !
you mean the wild mood swings ?

not bloody likely .
why did you make it do that ?
y ' see ? this is the stuff mom won ' t do with me .
i promise .
with a virgin tom collins for me ?
he hit us !
what is this crap ? are you wearing a wire ?
dad , look at me ! look at me !
she just found out no one likes her . i thought she knew !
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself .
you ' re not welcome .
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
lisa has a big toy ! no fair ! that means i get two small toys !
what ?
a real preacher knows how to bring the bible alive through music and dancing and tae-bo !
pay the man , homer .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
maybe laura could watch us .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
dad ! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g !
sure , why not ?
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
mom , is that true ?
no , i ' m not . i suck .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
yeah , but at least it was short .
hey , everybody . look what we got !
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
oh , yeah .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
now !
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
who are you talking to , homer ?
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
where are you really going ?
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
huh ?
dad , the mailman is here .
oh , man .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
should i get my helmet ?
you have a drinking problem ?
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
well , don ' t buy ' em !
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
there you go , ratboy .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
our book ! the real one !
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
cool man !
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
amen .
our book ! the real one !
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
what about my birthday party ?
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
now !
i ' ll supervise .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
right , dad .
but i thought uter took my place .
i want to watch krusty .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
all right !
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
and how .
amen .
right , dad .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
what happened ?
um hm .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
i ' m under thirty .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
yeah , but at least it was short .
why don ' t you buy it ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
what if she doesn ' t ?
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
should i get my helmet ?
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
okay , i ' m sold .
choose your corncob ! en garde !
uh-oh . school bus .
i ' ll supervise .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
don ' t give up , dad .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
right , dad .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
but i don ' t hate this country .
now that ' s a broken man .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
okay .
wow ! a big ugly head !
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
you have a drinking problem ?
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
you mean more popular but not as good ?
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
you think you ' re better than the great simpsini ? !
yeah , i ' d like to speak to a mr . tabooger . first name , ollie .
it ' s the first day of school .

aw , that ' s my krusty . i got a feeling he ' ll be allll-right .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
hey , what gives ?
yes !
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
dad , you ' re eating dr . phil !
there ' s twelve more boxes . and they all sound the same !

stupid kid . do you really think that ' s the way we should communicate ?
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
pay the man , homer .
throw hot wax on him , dad !
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "
hm . " thanks for letting us crash in your pad . we had a very nice time . "
yikes ! what is that ?
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .
whoa !
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !

dad , it ' s may 00th .
and who ' s your little school friend ? wait a minute , that ' s mom !
let ' s get this show on the road , man . we got things to do .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !

well , that ' s great , dad , except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper .
sounds scrump-didly-umptious , dear old daddly-doodly .
i ' ll just pay the fine .
hey look , maggie made you a farewell card .
he certainly has , dad . i learned a real lesson here today . thank you . dr . hibbert .

mom , do you have any idea how i got this scar ?
balloon ride , wax museum , the denzel washington monument , colonial phoenix , hey , dude ranch !
and he taught me how to do this .

you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?

you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . too thin .
hell , yes .
uh , right . do you know what a wet willie is ?
what ' s with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?

but they stole our lemon tree !
waaaaaaaah !
no , not really .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
but i want to see it !
i had a run-in with a bully .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
aw , that ' s my krusty . i got a feeling he ' ll be allll-right .
he ' s damn opposed ! damn ! damn ! damn opposed !
y ' see ? this is the stuff mom won ' t do with me .
wow . so that ' s how lisa got her sax .

oh , can we keep him dad , please ?
hey , mom , can we go see dad put out the fire ?
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .

and who ' s your little school friend ? wait a minute , that ' s mom !

hey dad , why don ' t we watch you drink from a hose ?
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
hey , wait ! i smell hamburgers too .
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
aw , come on , dad , be a foodie ! you ' re already a fatty and a drunkie !

i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
no , dad , they ' re the opposite .
dad , the car !
throw hot wax on him , dad !
it ' s just forks and plates . didn ' t we bring any food ?
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
the flanders are a buncha geeks , man .
cowabunga one to fat load .

check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
it ' s gone .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
well , i wish homer was here .
dad !
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
now that ' s a broken man .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
yes , sir !
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
testify !
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
but i don ' t hate this country .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
i could take up smoking .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
huh ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
. . . dad .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
well , i wish homer was here .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .

aw , come on .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
busted !
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
foxy boxing ?
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
what happened ?
except a place to live and free food .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
christmas .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
cool man !
because we ' re poor ?
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
amen , brother .
can i ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
tons .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
amen .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
what if someone catches him ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
i suppose .
okay , i promise .
hey , look , another spaceship !
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
what are you talking about ?
dad !
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
you got it .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
therapy , please .
mom .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
milhouse abandoned me .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
okay , i ' m sold .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
okay .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
oh , yeah .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i was faking it .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
paw !
can i ask you something , dad ?
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
amen .
right .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
no , we need to sail !
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
you can ' t make us come down .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
right .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
i was faking it .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
what ?
i understand why . you were wasted .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
what ?
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
look , that ' s our ship !
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
does something smell funny in here ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
testify !
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
yes , sir !
again ! again !
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
can i ask you something , dad ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
well , yeah , but --
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
yeah , their guns are right there !
agreed .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
who are you talking to , homer ?
mine has a cup holder !
i already do that .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
ay carumba !
um hm .
well , i wish homer was here .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
no me gusto . que lastima .
we ' re out of waffles .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
you could be my father figure .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
i could take up smoking .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
well , no .
no .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
milhouse abandoned me .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
not so tough now , huh ?
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
what if she doesn ' t ?
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
i ' m bart .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
sure you were , rummy .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
the fat guy on tv ?
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
yes , sir .
company physical coming up , huh ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
ay carumba !
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
okay , i promise .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
mine has a cup holder !
hey , look , another spaceship !
dad , the plan !

wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
what about the people on the bottom ?
look at me ! i ' m doin ' something !
nooooo !

i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
i don ' t want to take drugs .

this squishee is awful !

i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
how could you have it planned out ? you just heard about the problem .
dad , no !
dad !
oh , so many wasted nights . . .
you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
dad , i ' m asking if i can get a job .
why did you make it do that ?
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
get lost .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .
huh ?
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
wait , dad , look !
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
hey , check it out !
i suppose .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i could take up smoking .
oops , my homework !
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
dad , it-it ' s me !
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
because we ' re poor ?
there you go , ratboy .
oops , my homework !
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
tons .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !

i ' m just mad all the time .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
huh ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
more like the " expandables " !
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
wait , dad , look !
hey , look , another spaceship !
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
who are you talking to , homer ?
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
what ? no !
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
amen .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
i already do that .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
where are you going ?
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
so what if i am ?
does something smell funny in here ?

hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
yes , sir .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
work that body , homer .
oh , it will not .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?

hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
mount kilimanjaro ?

i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
why would i want a nap ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
who are you talking to , homer ?
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
you ' re the boss .
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
huh ?
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
what happened ?
did you check your pocket ?
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
tons .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
dad !
i suppose .
where did the ship stop again ?
but she might say no .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
you think so ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
except a place to live and free food .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
amen .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
what about sunday ?
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
what if she doesn ' t ?
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
we know , dad . we were there .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
should i get my helmet ?
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
what the ?
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
nice try , homer .
dad , how drunk are you ?
cool !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
so , you fought all those robots ?
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
teamwork is overrated .
you c ' mere a minute .
should i get my helmet ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
dad !
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
look , that ' s our ship !
did you check your pocket ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
tell it , daddy !
oh , man .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
so what if i am ?
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
oh , okay .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
hurry , homer !
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
an elephant ' s butt ?
cool man !
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i guess it ' s possible .
oops , my homework !
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
i thought you wanted me to drum !
oh , okay .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
right , dad .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?

hey , look , another spaceship !
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .

bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
why ?
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .

we ' re out of waffles .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
dad , you barely go to work at all .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .

dealing drugs ?
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
what ' d you do with all the loot ?
fine .
uh , dad ?
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
dad , come back ! i can ' t walk home with all this stuff !
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
um , i ' ve gotta make a phone call .

the last place i saw it . . .
this is so humiliating .
maybe .
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
you didn ' t do anything .
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
does anyone here like food ?
what did i do ?
there ' s twelve more boxes . and they all sound the same !

can ' t live this way . . . anymore .
hey , what gives ?
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
pound him , dad !
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .

no , dad , he ' s my friend !
like what ? they ' ll do something with you that they hate ?
oh yes we do ! i got it all on tape .

ow ! you stepped on my arm !
who ' s gonna eat my homework now ?
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
in the cart .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
denied .
dad ? it says " non-toxic . "
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
come on dad , it ' d be weird .
no ! you never let me be mike singletary !
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
yeah , man .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
deal .
the last place i saw it . . .

hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
hey , let ' s get one of those home satellite dishes ! then we can stop suckling on the six-network teat .
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
okay .
you think so ?
excellent .
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?

what ? why ?
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
what ' d you do with all the loot ?
it ' s on the back of our vests .
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
you can ' t come back later because . . .
i like the beat -- play me the tune .
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
man , that ' s some story .
says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring .
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
hey , how come lisa gets a pony ?
you ' re up to something , aren ' t you ?
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
gangway ! gotta poop .
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
no , but . . .
wait , is the hulk laughing , or the rhinoceros ?

ah well , maybe just one more hour .
you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
there ' s the rich texan -- and his daughter , paris texan .

it ' s the first day of school .
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
go ! go ! go ! now ' s your chance !
why did you make it do that ?
dad , i ' m asking if i can get a job .
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
she makes me taste beer .

what ' s your system ?
give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
since when ?
can ' t live this way . . . anymore .
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?
the store detective !
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
i ' ll get back to you .
dad , that ' s a sports bra .

bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
he ' s trained to do all sorts of stuff . he can herd sheep and perform cpr .
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
lethal inject her on the electric chair !
they have it now .
okay , okay .
stupid kid . do you really think that ' s the way we should communicate ?
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?
yeah .
we know you ' re innocent , dad .
and who ' s your little school friend ? wait a minute , that ' s mom !
pound him , dad !

wow , look at all this loot ! what should we buy first ?
oh !
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
oh , yeah .
like to see you fit .
life is good .
the last place i saw it . . .
i got my tenure right here .
lisa , do you really need all these kurt vonnegut novels ?
eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .
i got my tenure right here .
well , your father was a loser . and his father . and his father . it ' s genetic , man .
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
monsters ! monsters ! monsters !
not bloody likely .
i love our tuesdays together , dad .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
yeah , thanks a lot , flanders .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
can ' t live this way . . . anymore .
anything ' s better than that dump we came from .
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
whoa careful , dad . blow a gasket and you lose your job .
one stinkin ' letter ? why ' d you make us gather ' round like that ?
can ' t live this way . . . anymore .
nice use of the lingo , homer .

oh , how come i never get any mail ?
she makes me taste beer .
you ' re stifling my creativity , dad .
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
wait , is the hulk laughing , or the rhinoceros ?
what ' s a chachi ?
but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
whoa !
well , it used to be .
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
for what ?
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
wow . two .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
i promise .
really ?
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .
oh , yeah .

and it ' s on this dvd !
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .

correction : finished manuscript .
hey , homer , you promised mom you wouldn ' t wear your dress outside .
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
and it ' s on this dvd !
what ' d you do with all the loot ?
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
huh ?
ah , dad , if just me , milhouse and lewis had voted . . .
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
that ' s a hitchhiker , homer .
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
dad ? it says " non-toxic . "
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
hell , yes .
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .
fine . take it .
maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . too thin .
who ' s gonna eat my homework now ?
yeah ! let ' s go skiing ! / yeah , dad . let ' s go !
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
what time ?
she should be back now . it ' s dinner time .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
i sure hope not .
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !

uh , nothin ' , pop .
will i ever play baseball again ?
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
quiet , dad , or we ' ll have to throw you outta here .
i guess .
you ' re here , aren ' t you ?
hey mom , can i have some money to buy dad a present ?
no . i won ' t .
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .
just some report i gotta do for school . hey , you want some pie ?
wait . only that ship is going to mars . our ' s is headed for the sun .
i promise .
but you said i could go if i paid for the ticket !
um , hey , dad , i , i think he wants a . . .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
just dump ' em in the fire , dad .
what about my birthday party ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
the fat guy on tv ?
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
you can ' t make us come down .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
what if she doesn ' t ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
he said what now ?
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
aw , dad .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
you c ' mere a minute .
the fat guy on tv ?
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
can i ?
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
not so tough now , huh ?
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
i was faking it .
sure you were , rummy .
mount kilimanjaro ?
i ' ll supervise .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
what if someone catches him ?
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
you think so ?
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
it ' s a deal .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
but i don ' t hate this country .
mom .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
but i don ' t hate this country .
but i thought uter took my place .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
the nineties ? never heard of it .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
what about my birthday party ?
tell it , daddy !
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
. . . dad .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
okay , i ' m sold .
because we ' re poor ?
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
i ' m bart .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
did you check your pocket ?
well , you told her , dad .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
testify !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
mine has a cup holder !
can i ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
uh-oh . school bus .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
what about my birthday party ?
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
sure , why not ?
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
yeah .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
well , i wish homer was here .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
so what if i am ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
oh , man .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
foxy boxing ?
but i thought uter took my place .
oh , man .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
nice try , homer .
does something smell funny in here ?
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
can i stay with you , dad ?
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
dad , i promise i ' ll be good .
no , look ! it ' s a ride that just opened and no one ' s there !
incontinent . . . too rich .
yikes ! what is that ?
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
she said " yes . "
hell no .
i ' ll do it this afternoon . . .
oh , okay .
i liked it when it was me , mom and homer . you wrecked everything . i ' m leaving . goodbye .
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
what the hell are you talkin ' about ? you ' re the one who double dared us .
square as " golden books , " pop .
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .
. . . but let ' s see what you know about super-heroes .
well , just this week , there ' s been field day , picking me up from the airport . . .
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?
dad , look at me ! look at me !
i ' ve got a partner .
our teacher .
pound him , dad !
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
dad , isn ' t this stealing ?
c ' mon , dad . i gotta go to the bathroom .
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
we ' re still gonna make it , aren ' t we dad ?
quick gramma , hide !
ashes to ashes . . . dust to dust . . . we ' ve gotta go fight some robots .
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
i ' m chiquita banana / and i ' m here to say . . .
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?
dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .
uh . . .
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
my father . what a buffoon .
any thoughts on how we ' re gonna get there ?
but they stole our lemon tree !
oh , this sucks . i want to see vice-president cletus .
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .
ahhhh . welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer bart simpson .
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
nuh-uh .
what discussion ?
starting today , we ' re carnies . just like you .
you ' ll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
yeah . there ' s just no way to resist it , is there ?
i wanna show you i understand how you feel . and they say a picture ' s worth a thousand words :
dad , come back ! i can ' t walk home with all this stuff !
you think so ?
excellent .
you ' re up to something , aren ' t you ?
oh fine .
really ? ! oh , how terrible !
what are you doing ?
it hurts when i swallow .
dad , there ' s a bunch of people in the community outreach center .
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
y ' see ? this is the stuff mom won ' t do with me .
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
and we have plenty more on homer simpson .
awesome ! how ' s he getting around ?
it ' s eight in the morning !
dad !
gangway ! gotta poop .
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
i ' m sorry .
gangway ! gotta poop .
you bet i do .

homeroom , eight a . m .
he ' s just flamboyant .
it ' s over there , nelson .
i had a run-in with a bully .

we never had a family meeting before .
oh , please ! this is senseless destruction , with none of my usual social commentary .
what happened to you , man ? you used to be cool .
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
oh , yeah .
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .

look at me ! i ' m doin ' something !
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
squawky ?
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
well , your father was a loser . and his father . and his father . it ' s genetic , man .
you the man , homer .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .

you can always find your favorite shows next month .
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !

don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
look at me ! i ' m doin ' something !
when you ' re gettin ' juiced , can you hold my turtle ? i wanna bring him back to life .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
yes . " do you wet your pants ? " well , even the best of us has an occasional accident .
her pillow ' s stuck .
oh , okay .
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .
how could you have it planned out ? you just heard about the problem .
thanks for trying , guys , but sideshow bob wants me dead , and sideshow bob is an unstoppable killing machine .
yes sir .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
all right , the personals ! hmm . hm-hm-hm . " successful mayor-type seeks open-minded , discreet cheerleader-type . "
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
cool . mr . flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .
what ?
i ' m on it .
no ! stop the hovering !
you sure this is a good idea ?
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
i ' ll just pay the fine .
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
are you still talking about the earth ?
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .

hey , how come lisa gets a pony ?
hey , look what i found !
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !

that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
dad . . . i couldn ' t stay with mom and lisa while you were out here .
lisa , lisa ! i think you ' re right about dad . something ' s very , very wrong here .
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
it hurts when i swallow .
crank it , homer .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
well , maybe i should .
you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .

i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .

then i ' ll have been on every continent .
i don ' t wanna do that .
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
you think so ?
hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
i understand why . you were wasted .
but i don ' t hate this country .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .

the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
what do you think ?

oh , it will not .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
right .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !

and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
we ' re on food stamps ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .

you mean i can go ?
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
why ?

dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
we know , dad . we were there .
who ' s in there ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
well , no .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
what if she doesn ' t ?
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
uh-oh . school bus .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
look , that ' s our ship !
more like balder and wider .

more like balder and wider .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
not so tough now , huh ?
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
you spent all the money i earned ? !
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
who ' s in there ?
dad , it-it ' s me !
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
fat guy number three ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
you got it .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
homer , you ate their jerky .
you ' re the boss .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .

i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
oh , man .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .

they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .

dad , how drunk are you ?
sure , why not ?
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !

well , yeah , but --
amen .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
wait , dad , look !
yeah !
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
hey , what smells so good ?
you think so ?
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
all righty !
i thought it was chocolate milk !
hey , check it out !
perish the thought .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
oops , my homework !

i thought it was chocolate milk !
gotcha . well , gotta go .

why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
now that ' s a broken man .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .

i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
hey !

people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
you got it .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?

i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
all right !
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .

i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
where did the ship stop again ?
i thought you wanted me to drum !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
who ' s in there ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
why ?
testify !
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
aw , dad .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
yes , sir .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
did you check your pocket ?
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .

i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .

let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .

dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
you could be my father figure .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .

then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .

oops , my homework !
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
anything slim !
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
i ' m under thirty .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
we are home .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
aw thanks , dad .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
you have a drinking problem ?
okay , i ' m sold .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
what if someone catches him ?
right , dad .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
yuk !
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
sure you were , rummy .
slurp my snot .
but dad . . .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
aw thanks , dad .
yes , sir .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
tons .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
okay , i ' m sold .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
perish the thought .
what ?
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
tell it , daddy !
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
fresh out .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
mount kilimanjaro ?
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .

oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
we are home .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .

i was thinking more of the deep fryer .

gimme a " b " ?
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .
what ' s his problem ?
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
mom , do you have any idea how i got this scar ?
i have a question .
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
think you ' ll win ?
homer . nyahhh .
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !
dad ?
we tricked you ! / eat nerf , homeboy !
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?
yee-hawww !
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
starting today , we ' re carnies . just like you .
what ' s it to ya ?
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .

huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .
excellent .
no ! you never let me be mike singletary !
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .
uh , dad ?

spuckler mary , please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance . . .
praise the lord .
man , that ' s some story .

wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
well , yeah , but --
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
dad , the plan !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
i concur .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
there you go , ratboy .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
hey , what smells so good ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
aw , dad .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
how do you know ?
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
i concur .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
paw !
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
well . . .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
more like balder and wider .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
can i stay with you , dad ?
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
choose your corncob ! en garde !
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
hey , look , another spaceship !
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
tell it , daddy !
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
i already do that .
except a place to live and free food .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
but i thought uter took my place .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
what an odd thing to say .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
what the ?
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
more like balder and wider .
now that ' s a broken man .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
okay , i promise .
work that body , homer .
our book ! the real one !
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !

whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
not bloody likely .
hey look , maggie made you a farewell card .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
gimme ! i want more !
wow ! can i see your club ?
ay carumba !
hey , there ' s a bug that looks like dad . let ' s kill it .

dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
yeah , and a good dad wouldn ' t miss his son ' s little league games !
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .
not bloody likely .
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .

hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .
nuh-uh , ' cause we called it .
nelson took my lunch money again !
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
so in a way , we ' d just be balancing out the universe .
okay .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
thanks dad .
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .

one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .

i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
not so tough now , huh ?
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
oh , yeah .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
go for it .
hey , everybody . look what we got !
christmas .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
amen , brother .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
sure , why not ?
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
what an odd thing to say .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
hey , look , another spaceship !
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
but she might say no .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
mom , is that true ?
work that body , homer .
no reason . brother .
except a place to live and free food .
now !
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
now !
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
busted !
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
sure , why not ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?

i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
okay , i promise .

dad , you barely go to work at all .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
what ?
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
paw !
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
mom .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
oh , man .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
we know , dad . we were there .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
what do you think ?
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
where did the ship stop again ?
your electric hammer , maestro ?
except a place to live and free food .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
yeah .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
tell it , daddy !
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
put it in the bank .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
how do you know ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
can i stay with you , dad ?
yeah , their guns are right there !
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
mount kilimanjaro ?
more like the " expandables " !
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
where are you going ?
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
perish the thought .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
thanks , dad .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
okay , i ' m sold .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
why ?
work that body , homer .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
dad !
but i thought you loved edison .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
yeah .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
teamwork is overrated .
we know , dad . we were there .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
therapy , please .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
what about adultery ?
what ?
well , no .
what ?
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
where did the ship stop again ?
yeah , but at least it was short .
where are you really going ?
then what was in the coffin ?
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
i can help you .
he said what now ?
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
well , no .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
yeah .
yeah !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
yes , sir .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
okay , i promise .
you think so ?
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
aw thanks , dad .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
yes , sir .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
we ' re out of waffles .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
i thought you wanted me to drum !
therapy , please .

what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
no .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
can i have a beer ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
look , that ' s our ship !
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
can i ask you something , dad ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
not so tough now , huh ?
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
well , no .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
homer , you ate their jerky .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
mount kilimanjaro ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
can i ?
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
look , that ' s our ship !
where are you going ?
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
what if someone catches him ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
where are you going ?
foxy boxing ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
tell it , daddy !
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
it ' s your birthday ?
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
can i stay with you , dad ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
what about abraham lincoln ?
the fat guy on tv ?
oops , my homework !
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
fat guy number three ?
no , we need to sail !
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
i guess it ' s possible .
why would i want a nap ?
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
testify !
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
you ' re the boss .
so , you fought all those robots ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
well , i wish homer was here .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
not so tough now , huh ?
what about sunday ?
yes , sir !
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
why would i want a nap ?
krusty !
so , you fought all those robots ?
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
hey , everybody . look what we got !
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .

you think so ?
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
oh , man .

no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
okay , i ' m sold .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
hey , what smells so good ?
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
i understand why . you were wasted .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
then what was in the coffin ?
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
an elephant ' s butt ?
yeah !
yeah , but at least it was short .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
krusty !
can i ?
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
yeah !
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
what the ?
uh-oh . school bus .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
i understand why . you were wasted .
yeah , but at least it was short .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
why ?
why would i want a nap ?
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
busted !
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
you could be my father figure .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
wow ! a big ugly head !
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
there you go , ratboy .
you think so ?
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
but dad . . .
oh , okay .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
therapy , please .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
christmas .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
hey , everybody . look what we got !
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
yes , sir .
i ' m under thirty .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
therapy , please .
i suppose .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
you mean i can go ?
now that ' s a broken man .
amen , brother .
i want to watch krusty .
ay carumba !
you c ' mere a minute .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
not so tough now , huh ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
but i thought you loved edison .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
amen .
right , dad .
oh , man .
right , dad .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
i didn ' t take it .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
can i have a beer ?
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
but she might say no .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
why ?
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
more like the " expandables " !
hey !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
not so tough now , huh ?
company physical coming up , huh ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
they ' re not mine . my boss said his warehouse was full .
hello ?
oh !
aye carumba !
aw , that ' s my krusty . i got a feeling he ' ll be allll-right .
buh .
no .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
since when ?
sounds scrump-didly-umptious , dear old daddly-doodly .
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
throw hot wax on him , dad !

dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--

yikes ! what is that ?
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "

we said " meh . "

anything ' s better than that dump we came from .
you know , for a while , i was kinda looking forward to bein ' a dad .
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
dad , you can ' t eat all those free samples . we ' ve got to get lisa ' s present .
well , just this week , there ' s been field day , picking me up from the airport . . .
oh how do i know this isn ' t some beautiful dream , too ?

oh , dad , you are the living end .
maybe laura could watch us .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
what are you doing ?
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
no belching .

dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
no .
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !

you could be my father figure .
i ' ve kissed three girls .

hey , that ' s my badge , homer .

well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
you mean i can go ?
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .

dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
don ' t give up , dad .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
oh , it will not .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
it ' s gone .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
dad , it-it ' s me !
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
who are you talking to , homer ?
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
you got it .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
thanks , pop .
you mean i can go ?
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .

a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
why ?

dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
hey , what smells so good ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
hey , what smells so good ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
yeah !
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .

uh-oh . school bus .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
milhouse abandoned me .
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
where are you going ?
tv sucks .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
fat guy number three ?
ay carumba !

hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
do shut up ?
there you go , ratboy .
nice try , homer .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
what about my birthday party ?
i understand why . you were wasted .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
no me gusto . que lastima .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
aw thanks , dad .
that movie ' s for babies .
i already do that .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
okay , i promise .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
what about sunday ?
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
krusty !
put it in the bank .
he said what now ?
why don ' t you buy it ?
why ?
tv sucks .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
amen .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
can i ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
who are you talking to , homer ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
where did the ship stop again ?
therapy , please .
fat guy number three ?
well , you told her , dad .
bart simpson , at your service .
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
where are you going ?
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
well , i wish homer was here .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
we ' re on food stamps ?
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
dad , you barely go to work at all .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
now !
yuk !
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
no .
amen , brother .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
yeah , but at least it was short .
aw , come on .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
fat guy number three ?
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
we are home .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
where are you really going ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
cheeky .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
no .
aw , come on .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
the fat guy on tv ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
you mean i can go ?
look , that ' s our ship !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
work that body , homer .
oh , man .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
you think so ?
hey , everybody . look what we got !
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
tons .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
so , you fought all those robots ?
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
i ' ve kissed three girls .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
thanks , dad .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
tell it , daddy !
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
yeah , their guns are right there !
yeah , their guns are right there !
anything slim !
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
did you check your pocket ?
dad , the plan !
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
but i thought uter took my place .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
amen , brother .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
there ' s no denying it , sis .
dad , the mailman is here .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
dad !
yuk !
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
yes , sir .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
krusty !
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
can i stay with you , dad ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
what are you talking about ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
paw !
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
what if someone catches him ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
dad , you barely go to work at all .
. . . dad .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
oh , man .
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
so , you fought all those robots ?
teamwork is overrated .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
oh , okay .
who are you talking to , homer ?
hit the road , " welcome home . "
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
all right !
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
put it in the bank .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
well . . .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
mine has a cup holder !
we know , dad . we were there .
uh-oh . school bus .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
tell it , daddy !
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
cheeky .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
amen .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
what ? no !
yeah .
now that ' s a broken man .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
gotcha . well , gotta go .
agreed .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
hey !
should i get my helmet ?
i suppose .
you got it .
yeah , but at least it was short .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
aw , dad .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
ay carumba !
i need this candy for school .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
what are you talking about ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
i ' m bart .
more like the " expandables " !
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
what a dump !
why ?
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
go for it .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
perish the thought .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
cool man !
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
but i thought uter took my place .
can i ask you something , dad ?
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
look , that ' s our ship !
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
we know , dad . we were there .
aw , come on .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
i didn ' t take it .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
i guess it ' s possible .

you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
right , dad .
but i thought uter took my place .

let ' s never miss the school bus again .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
yes , sir !

oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?

dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
but dad . . .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
we know , dad . we were there .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
you mean i can go ?
tell it , daddy !
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
more like the " expandables " !
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
we ' re on food stamps ?
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
company physical coming up , huh ?
should i get my helmet ?
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
i suppose .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
amen .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
what ? no !
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
does something smell funny in here ?
i guess it ' s possible .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
okay .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
christmas .
oh , yeah .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
you have a drinking problem ?
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
not so tough now , huh ?
what a dump !
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
oh , man .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
well , i wish homer was here .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
where are you going ?
ow ! !
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
ay carumba !
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
more like the " expandables " !
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
dad , how drunk are you ?
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
that movie ' s for babies .
fat guy number three ?
i guess it ' s possible .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
why would i want a nap ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
. . . dad .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
you could be my father figure .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
we are home .
tons .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
paw !
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
good for you . no more drinkin ' ?
i liked it when it was me , mom and homer . you wrecked everything . i ' m leaving . goodbye .
hello ?
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself .
isn ' t this supposed to be my project ?
dad ?
hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .
what ' s that ? a home-made bat ?
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
well , maybe i should .
we said " meh . "
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
i ' m sorry .
i ' m not the only one , homeboy .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
you had your hot dog plumped ?
lis , skinner is using you . like a pawn on his unholy chess set .
wait . only that ship is going to mars . our ' s is headed for the sun .
yeah , great workmanship .
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
ready . set . hut , hut !
nice use of the lingo , homer .
okay . rub a dub dub , thanks for the grub .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
hell no .

da-ad --
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
you ' re not welcome .
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
come on , dad . didn ' t you ever do anything wild when you were a kid ?
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
mom ! dad ! i saw sideshow bob and he threatened to kill me !
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
you know , it might ' ve been jimbo .
no , wait . i have a plan . but i ' ll need your underpants .
no , i mean the mailman ' s here .
what ' s wrong ?
dad , do you wear boxers or briefs ?
huh ?
i love you , dad .
oh , you mean krusty the clown ?
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
dad , come back ! i can ' t walk home with all this stuff !
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
what discussion ?
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
that ' s a hitchhiker , homer .
dad , it ' s may 00th .
nelson took my lunch money again !
fine .
oh , this is perfect .
good afternoon .
will i ever play baseball again ?
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
oh yeah , safety sells . especially to lame-o ' s .
but dad , my heart hurts .
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
you think so ?
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
the secret ingredient is blood .
i ' m going to get the dog back .
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
well , i ' m keeping this earring and you can ' t stop me !
she should be back now . it ' s dinner time .
the last place i saw it . . .
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
nyah-nyah , nyah , nyah-nyah-nyah ! nyah-nyah , nyah , nyah-nyah-nyah !
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .
there ' s this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me .
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
what ?
homer ?
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
yeah , i ' d like to speak to a mr . tabooger . first name , ollie .
not bloody likely .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
think about it . i mean , what " team " was babe ruth on ? who knows ?
don ' t you mean present ?
reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .
they ' re all about smugglers .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
you know , for a while , i was kinda looking forward to bein ' a dad .
hmmm . . . should i . . . or shouldn ' t i . . .
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
sounds scrump-didly-umptious , dear old daddly-doodly .
hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
wow ! we all have the same scar !
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
i am playing in the tournament .
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
i like the beat -- play me the tune .
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?
he did ?
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
so , uh , what ' s your hurry to get to school ?
what discussion ?
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
can i , for true ?
is that true ?
hey , dad . i ' m gonna make a human yo-yo . if you object , clearly say " no " .
you ' re the man , homer .
no , not really .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
oh , i thought i ' d check out the warner brothers network .
really ? ! oh , how terrible !
huh ?
hitler mash-ups .
all right !
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
yeah , this tether has some pluses .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
yeah , homer .
you think so ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
ay carumba !
can i ?
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
well . . .
who are you talking to , homer ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
hey , what smells so good ?
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
well . . .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
. . . dad .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
does something smell funny in here ?
well , yeah , but --
milhouse abandoned me .
what a dump !
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
the nineties ? never heard of it .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
where did the ship stop again ?
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
hey , i call first bedsies !
amen , brother .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
krusty !
go for it .
why ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
hey , what smells so good ?
dad , the plan !
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
sure you were , rummy .
paw !
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
what if someone catches him ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
who ' s in there ?
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
oh , man .
perish the thought .
now that ' s a broken man .
nice try , homer .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
what about abraham lincoln ?
should i get my helmet ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
our book ! the real one !
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
but i thought you loved edison .
krusty !
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
sure , why not ?
sure you were , rummy .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
what about abraham lincoln ?
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
what a dump !
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
yes , sir .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
oh , man .

thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
what an odd thing to say .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
cool !
you mean more popular but not as good ?
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
oh , man .
oh , it will not .
amen .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
now that ' s a broken man .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
what do you think ?
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
hey , what smells so good ?
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
well , don ' t buy ' em !
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
hey !
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .

hey , wait ! i smell hamburgers too .
i love our tuesdays together , dad .

sorry , dad . maybe now you ' ll appreciate us . . .
da-ad --
we don ' t need dental floss either , mom .
nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
homer .
not to mention hilarious .
but dr . hibbert said not to stress her out .
well , it used to be .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
i never heard of this new hospital so i looked it up and printed it out .
dad , come back ! i can ' t walk home with all this stuff !
it ' s not just a megaphone , dad . it ' s a rapmaster 0000 .
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
no , look ! it ' s a ride that just opened and no one ' s there !
you ' re the man , homer .
oh , can we keep him dad , please ?
hey mom , can i have some money to buy dad a present ?
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
aw , man ! we just missed it .
i ' m trying , dad .
oh , okay .
good for you . no more drinkin ' ?
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
so are we going to the lake or what ?
well his parents aren ' t married , are they ? it ' s the correct word , isn ' t it ?
here you go , dad . i hope you like it . i ' ve forgotten what it is .
dad ' s been doing that for two hours !
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
sorry , i ' ve got a baseball game in fifteen minutes .
way to go , dad !
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
big deal . i don ' t like girls either .
the last place i saw it . . .
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
what ' s with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?

i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .

he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
dad , it-it ' s me !
i was faking it .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .

no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .

what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .

you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .

well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
why would i want a nap ?

not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
right , dad .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
all righty !
you mean like we just did ?
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

dad , the plan !
choose your corncob ! en garde !
but i thought you loved edison .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
mount kilimanjaro ?
cheeky .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
more like balder and wider .
not so tough now , huh ?
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
but i don ' t hate this country .
ay carumba !
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
i want to watch krusty .

games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
can i ask you something , dad ?
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?

what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .

there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .

this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?

i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
sure you were , rummy .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .

what the hell was that ?
nuh-uh .
yeah .

he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .

i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
dad !

so what if i am ?
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !

well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .

dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !

you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !

i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
hurry , homer !
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
thanks , pop .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
i ' m under thirty .

you have a drinking problem ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
yes , sir !
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
dad !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .

dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
i want to watch krusty .
um hm .

hey , look , another spaceship !
oh , man .

you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
fresh out .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
company physical coming up , huh ?
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
i understand why . you were wasted .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
i ' m under thirty .
uh-oh . school bus .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
huh ?
perish the thought .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
who are you talking to , homer ?
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
aw thanks , dad .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
ay carumba !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
because we ' re poor ?
right , dad .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
who ' s in there ?
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
does something smell funny in here ?
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
fresh out .
well , no .
you could be my father figure .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
i was faking it .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
i want to watch krusty .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
i understand why . you were wasted .
okay .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
what an odd thing to say .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
fresh out .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
dad ? !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
that movie ' s for babies .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
you ' re the boss .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
can i have a beer ?
huh ?
yes , sir .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
fresh out .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
testify !
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
mount kilimanjaro ?
why ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
teamwork is overrated .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .

they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .

mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
who are you talking to , homer ?
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?

i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
you c ' mere a minute .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
why ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
oh , man .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .

we are home .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
nice try , homer .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !

okay , i promise .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .

don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .

mine has a cup holder !
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .

skinner didn ' t let me go .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .

a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
nice try , homer .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
i want to watch krusty .

country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
testify !

then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
what if someone catches him ?
i ' m under thirty .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "

why don ' t you buy it ?
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
eh , we could try it .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
it ' s gone .
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .

hey paris , i saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet . . . your face !

huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?

hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
homer , you ate their jerky .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
eh , we could try it .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
you mean i can go ?
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
but i don ' t hate this country .
work that body , homer .
because we ' re poor ?
what about adultery ?
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .

look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
now fly -- to the canary islands !
well , sure you do .
dad , how drunk are you ?
hey , i call first bedsies !
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
um hm .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
anything slim !
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
but she might say no .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
oops , my homework !
busted !
work that body , homer .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
why ?
your electric hammer , maestro ?
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?

well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
you c ' mere a minute .
all righty !
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
okay , i promise .
sure you were , rummy .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
christmas .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
aw , come on .
now that ' s a broken man .
well , sure you do .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
put it in the bank .
i concur .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
it ' s your birthday ?
amen .
mom , is that true ?
your electric hammer , maestro ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
aw thanks , dad .
i concur .
milhouse abandoned me .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
again ! again !
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
except a place to live and free food .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
i guess .
you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
when i raged against the machine , money poured out .
thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . too thin .
wow , look at all this loot ! what should we buy first ?
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
yes !
hey , he didn ' t pay the cover !
nice use of the lingo , homer .
dad , isn ' t this stealing ?
you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
one stinkin ' letter ? why ' d you make us gather ' round like that ?
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
heeere ' s bart !
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
building a soap box derby racer .
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
lis , skinner is using you . like a pawn on his unholy chess set .
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
man , that ' s some story .
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
dad , i promise i ' ll be good .
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .
dad ! we don ' t watch that show anymore !
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
no , not really .
oh yeah , safety sells . especially to lame-o ' s .
hitler mash-ups .
ow .
don ' t worry , i don ' t even like using the bathroom after you .
dad . . . i need help . . . please . . .
no .
who are beavis and butthead ?
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
okay .
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
uh , nothin ' , pop .
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?
hey , homer . this house sucks .
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
look , dad . barber hair .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
i can have all my birthday parties in it !

horrifying .
yeah , this tether has some pluses .
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
wow . so that ' s how lisa got her sax .
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
what about the people on the bottom ?
well . . . maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again .
hello ?
wait , i know . beer here !
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
he did ?
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
lethal inject her on the electric chair !
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
i ' m not the only one , homeboy .
so ?
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
yes !
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
are you still talking about the earth ?
it doesn ' t sound very tractor-y .
no .
homer !
hey , dad .
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
dad , you can ' t let him take our dog !
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
gee , sorry for being born .
praise the lord .
no , but . . .

tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
oh , oh . hey , cool , man .

dad , whatever you say , you know you will always have my love and respect .

alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?

maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
i ' m just mad all the time .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
why ?
christmas .
it ' s a deal .
right .
again ! again !
dad !
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
well , no .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .

dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
dad , the mailman is here .

i ' m just mad all the time .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
mom , is that true ?

maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .

it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
you mean i can go ?
foxy boxing ?
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
i understand why . you were wasted .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .

perish the thought .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !

homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
they ' re all about smugglers .
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
they ' ll buy anything !
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
hey look , maggie made you a farewell card .
i don ' t love you either . so give me a moped .
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .

c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
put it in the bank .
yuk !
it ' s gone .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
you could be my father figure .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
i didn ' t take it .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
amen .
amen .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
yes , sir !
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
you mean i can go ?
we ' re out of waffles .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
you mean more popular but not as good ?
i guess it ' s possible .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
mom .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
bart simpson , at your service .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
hey , what smells so good ?
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
hey , check it out !
there you go , ratboy .
no reason . brother .
sure you were , rummy .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
you could be my father figure .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
i ' m just mad all the time .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
but dad . . .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
you mean like we just did ?
who are you talking to , homer ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
what the ?
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
wait , dad , look !
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
there ' s no denying it , sis .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
what the ?
i ' m bart .
cheeky .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
i ' m just mad all the time .
no reason . brother .
mine has a cup holder !
well , no .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
eh , we could try it .
what the ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
not so tough now , huh ?
ay carumba !
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .

how do you know ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
dad !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
where did the ship stop again ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
hey , look , another spaceship !
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
our book ! the real one !
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
we ' re out of waffles .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
bart simpson , at your service .
wow ! a big ugly head !
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
not so tough now , huh ?
but i don ' t hate this country .
who ' s in there ?
not so tough now , huh ?
dad , it-it ' s me !
an elephant ' s butt ?
you mean more popular but not as good ?

i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
milhouse abandoned me .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
krusty !
. . . dad .
right .
we know , dad . we were there .
fat guy number three ?
aw , dad .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
can i stay with you , dad ?
tell it , daddy !
amen , brother .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
you can ' t make us come down .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
amen .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
hit the road , " welcome home . "
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
hey , i call first bedsies !
well , sure you do .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
who ' s in there ?
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
then what was in the coffin ?
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
i guess it ' s possible .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
now that ' s a broken man .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
can i stay with you , dad ?
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
hey , everybody . look what we got !
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
why don ' t you buy it ?
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
where did the ship stop again ?
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
cool !
what a dump !
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
yeah .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
thanks , dad .
what ? no !
it ' s goose !
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
do shut up ?
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
i was faking it .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
fresh out .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
cool man !
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
hullo ?

games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
it ' s a deal .

hey , check it out !
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
it ' s your birthday ?
ay carumba !
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
choose your corncob ! en garde !
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
mom . get him away from the window .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
did you check your pocket ?
amen , brother .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
mom , is that true ?
okay , i promise .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
who ' s in there ?
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
well , no .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
cool !
wow , i never thought of it like that .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
no .
mom .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
don ' t give up , dad .
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .

yeah , their guns are right there !
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
testify !

you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
i want to watch krusty .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
you could be my father figure .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
oh , yeah .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
yuk !
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
dad !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
glad you didn ' t come cheap .

you mean i can go ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
hullo ?
so what if i am ?
now !
so , you fought all those robots ?
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
do shut up ?

why the hell would i want to see that ?
it ' s your birthday ?
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
what happened ?
foxy boxing ?
you mean more popular but not as good ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
amen .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .

hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .

there ' s no denying it , sis .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
what if someone catches him ?

she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
i didn ' t take it .

i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?

i ' m under thirty .
because we ' re poor ?

tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
i can help you .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
but dad . . .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .

why would i want a nap ?
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !

no , we need to sail !
wow , i never thought of it like that .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .

i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .

dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
mount kilimanjaro ?
what about sunday ?

should i get my helmet ?
i was faking it .
um hm .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
okay .
more like the " expandables " !
what happened ?

because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
not so tough now , huh ?

dad , the bill ' s only a hundred .
aw , come on , dad . get the lead out .

pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
you ' ll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .

there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !
can we say it ' s my birthday and get free stuff ?
then i ' ll have been on every continent .
dad , over here !

hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .

dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
the secret ingredient is blood .

i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
what the hell are you talkin ' about ? you ' re the one who double dared us .
no , sir .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
please , fbi man , don ' t throw us in jail . we just made one mistake .
no , sir .
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
well , your father was a loser . and his father . and his father . it ' s genetic , man .
have you been " oh boy " -ing all night ?

we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
i could take up smoking .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
why ?
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
oh , okay .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
except a place to live and free food .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
so , you fought all those robots ?
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
what if someone catches him ?
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
who are you talking to , homer ?
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?

hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !

hey , i call first bedsies !
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
what happened ?
it ' s goose !
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
can i stay with you , dad ?

i was faking it .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .

i thought you wanted me to drum !
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .

this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .

i already do that .

should i get my helmet ?
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
well , no .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
why ?
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !

i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .

yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
a real swiss army knife . cool !

you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .

i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !

it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
thanks , pop .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
then what was in the coffin ?
i ' ll supervise .
not so tough now , huh ?
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
sure , why not ?
dad !
cheeky .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
you can ' t make us come down .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
yeah , but at least it was short .
well , you told her , dad .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
you got it .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
tell it , daddy !
yes , sir .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
you think so ?
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
why would i want a nap ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
no , i ' m not . i suck .
amen .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
homer !
you spent all the money i earned ? !
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
you mean like we just did ?
not so tough now , huh ?
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
nice try , homer .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
sure , why not ?
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
i already do that .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
what about sunday ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
yeah , but at least it was short .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
what ? no !
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
eh , we could try it .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
no , i mean teacher .
she said " yes . "

they have it now .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
i had a run-in with a bully .

don ' t worry , i know just what to do .
mom ' s not gonna like this .
in about two seconds .
no , don ' t ! you have to protect yourself !
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
cool !
our book ! the real one !
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
can i have a beer ?
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
thanks , pop .
thanks , pop .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
i can help you .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
yeah , but at least it was short .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
again ! again !
we ' ve seen it , dad .
what are you talking about ?
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
and how .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
mine has a cup holder !
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
again ! again !
now fly -- to the canary islands !
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
hit the road , " welcome home . "
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
fat guy number three ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
not so tough now , huh ?
what about sunday ?
cool man !
hurry , homer !
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
dad , you barely go to work at all .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
you c ' mere a minute .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
agreed .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
you have a drinking problem ?
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
i ' ll supervise .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
well , you told her , dad .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
why would i want a nap ?
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
next .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
thanks , dad .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
right .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
what do you think ?
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
amen .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
wait a minute . they ' re not so great .
gangway ! gotta poop .
huh ?
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
i ' ll get back to you .
they have it now .
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
think you ' ll win ?
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
whoa ! yeah , strike three ! you ' re outta there .
no . i won ' t .
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
it ' s okay dad , i can fill in for nelson .
good evening , adults .
gotcha .
dad , isn ' t this stealing ?
what a sap !
oh yeah ? they made you build this statue .
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
don ' t you mean present ?
nelson ' s a great quarterback . he ' s carryin ' this team !
hello ?
homer !
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
you ' re stifling my creativity , dad .
everything .
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
denied .
dad . . . i couldn ' t stay with mom and lisa while you were out here .
dad . . . i need help . . . please . . .
i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
but wouldn ' t that make us con artists ?
praise the lord .
fine .
dad ?
i don ' t want to take drugs .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
just one , and it ' s across town .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
wait . only that ship is going to mars . our ' s is headed for the sun .
uh-huh .
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
then i ' ll have been on every continent .
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?
it ' s mergatronic , daddy-ho .
nuh-uh .

ready . set . hut , hut !
shaddap !
we said " meh . "
but they stole our lemon tree !
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
all right !
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
maybe laura could watch us .
hey , let ' s get one of those home satellite dishes ! then we can stop suckling on the six-network teat .
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
hmmm . . . should i . . . or shouldn ' t i . . .
everything .
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
seriously dad , i ' m worried . you should go on a diet .
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
what ' s his problem ?
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
are you kidding ? i reeked !
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
fine . take it .
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
hey , homer ! check it out !
okay .
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
i ' ll do it this afternoon . . .

if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
i guess .

dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?

look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .

we ' re all proud of you , dad .
i ' m going to get the dog back .

i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
uh oh .

one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .
hey , that ' s my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated , eight-fold , fourteen-gauge box .
whoa ! they like each other !
hey , wait ! i smell hamburgers too .
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
one stinkin ' letter ? why ' d you make us gather ' round like that ?

dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
oh , go for it , dad .
you mean the wild mood swings ?
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
lisa ! dad ! c ' mere quick ! there is something that you won ' t believe !

we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .

building a soap box derby racer .
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
yes , sir .
dad , you ' re eating dr . phil !
what ' s it to ya ?
praise the lord .
maybe laura could watch us .
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
dad , only one of them is real .
pay the man , homer .
today we learned how to rip a man ' s heart out and show it to him before he dies .
well , it used to be .
oh !
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
hey , dad . i ' m gonna make a human yo-yo . if you object , clearly say " no " .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
okay .

indeed i did .
the flanders are a buncha geeks , man .

i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
what about the people on the bottom ?
where do the people sit ?
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?
what ' s with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?
dad . . .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
gimme ! i want more !
aren ' t we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?
hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
wow ! can i see your club ?
oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?
very nice .
dad , the plan !
ay carumba !
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
well . . .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
what ? no !
right , dad .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
so what if i am ?
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
fat guy number three ?
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
right .
yes , sir .
no , we need to sail !
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
what do you think ?
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
ay carumba !
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
all righty !
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
oh , man .
sure you were , rummy .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
except a place to live and free food .
homer !
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
but she might say no .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
we are home .
teamwork is overrated .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
all righty !
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
all right !
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
teamwork is overrated .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
but i thought you loved edison .
what are you talking about ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
dad !
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
where are you going ?
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
because we ' re poor ?
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
you mean like we just did ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
well , no .
homer , you ate their jerky .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
nice try , homer .
hey , i call first bedsies !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
sure , why not ?
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
milhouse abandoned me .
oh , man .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
yeah .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
where are you really going ?
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
dad ? !
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
perish the thought .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
who are you talking to , homer ?
fresh out .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
i ' m under thirty .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
it ' s a deal .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
hey , everybody . look what we got !
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
huh ?
you mean more popular but not as good ?
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
hurry up , dad !
i don ' t love you either . so give me a moped .
uh , right . do you know what a wet willie is ?
whooa !
but dr . hibbert said not to stress her out .
don ' t you mean present ?
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
. . . homer " the human punching bag " simpson . boo ! boo ! hiss !
d ' unno . why are your friends such drunks ?
man , that ' s some story .
sir , yes sir ! luckily , i am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat , sir !
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
but dad , my heart hurts .
thanks , dad .
so prepare yourself , for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan ' s , " paint your wagon ! "
can i , for true ?
will i ever play baseball again ?
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring .
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
gay out ?
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
i don ' t know , dad . what if she ' s still mad at me ?
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
dad , there ' s a bunch of people in the community outreach center .
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?
dad ?
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
you got it .
wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
thanks dad .
whatcha doin ' , mom ? goin ' crazy ?
dad . . .
it ' s not just a megaphone , dad . it ' s a rapmaster 0000 .
hmmm . . . should i . . . or shouldn ' t i . . .
quick gramma , hide !
you the man , homer .
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
sting !
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
well , i ' m keeping this earring and you can ' t stop me !
well , according to red ' s schedule , we have to make it to atlanta in three days .
shaddap !
aren ' t we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?
um , i ' ve gotta make a phone call .
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
and who ' s your little school friend ? wait a minute , that ' s mom !
like what ? they ' ll do something with you that they hate ?
bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
you had your hot dog plumped ?
are you kidding ? he ' s my idol . i ' ve based my whole life on krusty ' s teachings .
isn ' t this supposed to be my project ?
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
no , sir .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .
squealer .
wasn ' t skipping town in the first place a coward ' s way out ?
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
froggie , i ' m home .
you sure this is a good idea ?
not to mention hilarious .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
you bet i do .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .
well his parents aren ' t married , are they ? it ' s the correct word , isn ' t it ?
hey mom , can i have some money to buy dad a present ?
throw hot wax on him , dad !
yeah , you know her .
and it ' s on this dvd !
hey , man , i didn ' t do anything wrong .
you had your hot dog plumped ?
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?
what ' s with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
okay .
aw , come on , dad , be a foodie ! you ' re already a fatty and a drunkie !
get lost .
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
dad ?
you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
it ' s over there , nelson .
this is so humiliating .
he ' s trained to do all sorts of stuff . he can herd sheep and perform cpr .
no .
thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?
he hit us !
hey , mom , can we go see dad put out the fire ?
get lost .
oh yeah , safety sells . especially to lame-o ' s .
yay !
come on dad , it ' d be weird .
i ' m doing the conan o ' brien show and i wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about .
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
oh , this is perfect .
no time .
all right !
trying to fix your broken brain .
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
huh ?
so ?
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
he certainly has , dad . i learned a real lesson here today . thank you . dr . hibbert .
hey , mom , can we go see dad put out the fire ?
look , he thinks he ' s people .
squawky ?
no .
so prepare yourself , for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan ' s , " paint your wagon ! "
permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
there ' s this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me .
ah well , maybe just one more hour .
dear lisa . psych . psych , psych , psych . signed , super-psych .
are we ever going to be there ?

there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .

oh , it will not .
where did the ship stop again ?
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?

where are you really going ?
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
but i thought you loved edison .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
so , you fought all those robots ?
uh-oh . school bus .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .

fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .

yes , sir .
we are home .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
okay .
hey , i call first bedsies !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
well , i wish homer was here .
company physical coming up , huh ?
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
mom . get him away from the window .
wait , dad , look !
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
an elephant ' s butt ?
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
okay .

so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
no , we need to sail !
anything slim !
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .

you can ' t come back later because . . .
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
so prepare yourself , for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan ' s , " paint your wagon ! "

when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
it ' s not just a megaphone , dad . it ' s a rapmaster 0000 .

what ? why ?
thanks for trying , guys , but sideshow bob wants me dead , and sideshow bob is an unstoppable killing machine .
yeah , mom says a lot of things .

dad , isn ' t this stealing ?
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
i wanna show you i understand how you feel . and they say a picture ' s worth a thousand words :
it doesn ' t sound very tractor-y .
dad , l . t . ' s gone crazy !

i don ' t want to take drugs .
i can ' t take it anymore ! every time i try to relax , she-- ow , my neck !
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
well , just this week , there ' s been field day , picking me up from the airport . . .
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
dad ?
maybe laura could watch us .
beer ! beer is the cheese . but how to use it . . .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
hmmm . . . should i . . . or shouldn ' t i . . .

i am playing in the tournament .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .

why didn ' t you wait for me ?
her pillow ' s stuck .
well , according to red ' s schedule , we have to make it to atlanta in three days .
uh , dad ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
dad , it-it ' s me !
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
testify !
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
no , i ' m not . i suck .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
uh-oh . school bus .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
and how .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
can i stay with you , dad ?
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
nice try , homer .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
hey , what smells so good ?
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
why don ' t you buy it ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .

how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
foxy boxing ?
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
mom , is that true ?
you have a drinking problem ?
because we ' re poor ?
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .

i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
amen .

look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
mount kilimanjaro ?
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
mom . get him away from the window .
you can ' t make us come down .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
no me gusto . que lastima .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
company physical coming up , huh ?
huh ?
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
not so tough now , huh ?
we are home .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
homer , you ate their jerky .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
oh , yeah .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
next .
gotcha . well , gotta go .
company physical coming up , huh ?
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
now fly -- to the canary islands !
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
no , we need to sail !
you mean more popular but not as good ?
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
what are you talking about ?
amen .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
fat guy number three ?
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
why don ' t you buy it ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .

how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
bart simpson , at your service .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
what are you talking about ?
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
mom . get him away from the window .
fat guy number three ?
i guess it ' s possible .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
but i thought uter took my place .
dad !
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
should i get my helmet ?
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
you could be my father figure .
homer , you ate their jerky .
who ' s in there ?
huh ?
the nineties ? never heard of it .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i didn ' t take it .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
mount kilimanjaro ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
should i get my helmet ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
mom , is that true ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .

sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
where are you going ?
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
tons .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
fat guy number three ?
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
but i don ' t hate this country .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
our book ! the real one !
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
who ' s in there ?
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
an elephant ' s butt ?
but i don ' t hate this country .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
fresh out .
amen , brother .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
you ' re the boss .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
all right !
oh , man .
you have a drinking problem ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
can i ask you something , dad ?
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
it ' s a deal .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
what a dump !
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
paw !
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
the fat guy on tv ?
you spent all the money i earned ? !
wow ! a big ugly head !
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
slurp my snot .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
slurp my snot .
it ' s a deal .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
eh , we could try it .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
you can ' t make us come down .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
mount kilimanjaro ?
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
put him down , boy ! put him down !
her pillow ' s stuck .
i can ' t take it anymore ! every time i try to relax , she-- ow , my neck !
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
hey lame ass . thanks to you , we ' re stuck on a stupid therapy boat .
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .
yes , sir .
beer ! beer is the cheese . but how to use it . . .
there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !
so what ' s our first job , huh ? test the roller coaster ?
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
hey , there ' s a bug that looks like dad . let ' s kill it .
thanks dad .

nuh-uh , ' cause we called it .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
yeah .
not if i can help it .
sorry , dad . maybe now you ' ll appreciate us . . .
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
hey , wait ! i smell hamburgers too .
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
hey , homer , i found your weights .
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .
they ' ll buy anything !
dad , look who ' s in there !
how much ?
dad , you can ' t eat all those free samples . we ' ve got to get lisa ' s present .
nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
is that true ?
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
every day , same old cat . i ' ll make him more interesting .
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
it ' s not just a megaphone , dad . it ' s a rapmaster 0000 .
forget about it , homer . you made it to the top . you ' re the coolest dad ever .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .
sounds scrump-didly-umptious , dear old daddly-doodly .
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
yes it does .
i never heard of this new hospital so i looked it up and printed it out .
sting !
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
i like it in the cage . these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress .
have you been " oh boy " -ing all night ?
policeman .
and for the college-bound . . . 000 stay-alert capsules .
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
no .
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
indeed i did .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
i love you , dad .
just one , and it ' s across town .
but you said i could go if i paid for the ticket !
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
maybe .
why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
yeah .
amen .
hey , homer ! check it out !
well , it all started last week in krabappel ' s class . . .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
so in a way , we ' d just be balancing out the universe .
life is good .
and play !
praise the lord .
yeah , you know her .
dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
dad ' s been doing that for two hours !

homer !
and it ' s on this dvd !
what the hell was that ?
dad , isn ' t this stealing ?
you bet i do .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
the secret ingredient is blood .
but i want to see it !
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .

/ get your hands off of me , you fat ass--
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?

there you go . . thanks for comin ' out . . .
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
screw that . when i grow up , i ' m legally changing my name to joe kickass .
you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
and play !
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
see ya in the funny pages .
hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
if you call this living .
ow ! quit it . it used to be a real boss tattoo .
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
. . . so from now on , all hats are banned from the school .
nelson ' s a great quarterback . he ' s carryin ' this team !
wait . only that ship is going to mars . our ' s is headed for the sun .
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
oh , go for it , dad .
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
her pillow ' s stuck .
i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .
dad , you ' re a hero !
waaaaaaaah !
way to go , dad !
this is for love , dad . someday you ' ll feel what i feel .
way to go , dad !
well , i ' m keeping this earring and you can ' t stop me !
squawky ?
today we learned how to rip a man ' s heart out and show it to him before he dies .
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
gonna what , homer ?
yes it does .
oh , i thought i ' d check out the warner brothers network .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
praise the lord .
well his parents aren ' t married , are they ? it ' s the correct word , isn ' t it ?
dad , over here !
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
they took the bait . let ' s go .
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
hey dad , can we play ?
dad , no !
what ? why ?
i ' m bart simpson . who the hell are you ?
trying to fix your broken brain .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
with a virgin tom collins for me ?
squawky ?
huh ?
homer .
whoa careful , dad . blow a gasket and you lose your job .
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
i love you , dad .
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .
oh , check .
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
ah well , maybe just one more hour .
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
dad , over here !
dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
hell , yes .
i ' m gonna put my trophy on the mantle . how ' bout you ?
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
dad , the car !
but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
hey , that ' s my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated , eight-fold , fourteen-gauge box .
he did ?
trying to fix your broken brain .
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
oh , right . what ' d you get her , dad ?
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .

and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .

what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
okay , i promise .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
it ' s goose !
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
krusty !
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
i ' ll supervise .
put it in the bank .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
christmas .

toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !

this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
cool man !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
yes , sir .
mom .

it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
dad , you barely go to work at all .

balloon ride , wax museum , the denzel washington monument , colonial phoenix , hey , dude ranch !
have you been " oh boy " -ing all night ?
oh , please ! this is senseless destruction , with none of my usual social commentary .
bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
uh . . . toys ?
all right !
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
c ' mon , dad ! the team ' s arriving !
it ' s eight in the morning !
seriously dad , i ' m worried . you should go on a diet .

with a virgin tom collins for me ?
wow ! we all have the same scar !
but you said i could go if i paid for the ticket !
i ' ll get back to you .
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
the store detective !
anything ' s better than that dump we came from .
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
monsters ! monsters ! monsters !
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .
big if !
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
lisa , lisa ! i think you ' re right about dad . something ' s very , very wrong here .
thanks dad .
yeah , great workmanship .
aw , come on , dad , be a foodie ! you ' re already a fatty and a drunkie !
uh , dad ? laddie ' s not coming . i gave him away .
quick gramma , hide !
you are fully bonded and licensed by the city , aren ' t you mr . plow ?
you ' re up to something , aren ' t you ?
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
we ' ll see .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .
way to go , dad !
is uncle fester still alive ?
throw hot wax on him , dad !
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
yeah , dad ! you ' re a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
fine .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
i don ' t wanna do that .
you know , it might ' ve been jimbo .
come on , dad , just twelve more pounds .
dad , i promise i ' ll be good .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
locusts . they ' ll drive him nuts .
whoa careful , dad . blow a gasket and you lose your job .
hey , dad . i ' m gonna make a human yo-yo . if you object , clearly say " no " .
aw , rats , another gutter ball ! gee , homer , you sure do suck tonight !
okay .
but they stole our lemon tree !
i ' m on it .
cowabunga , dude !
oh .
you throw like my sister , man !
can i burn evidence in it ?
he did ?
well , it all started last week in krabappel ' s class . . .
lis , skinner is using you . like a pawn on his unholy chess set .
fine .
eh .
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
this squishee is awful !
you ' re the man , homer .
what ' s wrong ?
dad , l . t . ' s gone crazy !
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
if you call this living .
hey , homer , i found your weights .
who ' s the black private dick that ' s the sex machine to all the chicks ?
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
gonna what , homer ?
hit the road , ya big load !
is that the only reason ?
oh , dad , you are the living end .
we don ' t need dental floss either , mom .
this is so humiliating .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
i got suspended from school today .
mom . . . dad . i ' d give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together .
uh , he didn ' t say science . . . he said " pie pants . "
there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
dad , l . t . ' s gone crazy !
do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass ?
see ya in the funny pages .
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
c ' mon , dad ! the team ' s arriving !
but wouldn ' t that make us con artists ?
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
oh man , now she ' s writing cutesy things with the ribbon .
and it ' s on this dvd !
lisa it ' s your birthday /
. . . but let ' s see what you know about super-heroes .
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
square as " golden books , " pop .
the secret ingredient is blood .
with a virgin tom collins for me ?
yep .
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
since when ?
dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
her pillow ' s stuck .
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
looks like you lost the patient , doc .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
if you call this living .
just some report i gotta do for school . hey , you want some pie ?
wasn ' t skipping town in the first place a coward ' s way out ?
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
cowabunga , dude !
it hurts when i swallow .
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
big deal . i don ' t like girls either .
praise the lord .
hey , mom , can we go see dad put out the fire ?
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .
all right !
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
cowabunga one to fat load .
yes !
nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
yes !
thanks , dad . sure you ' re not gonna be bored ?
you ' re stifling my creativity , dad .
sounds like something you ' d say .
no i didn ' t , dad .
okay , okay .
dad , l . t . ' s gone crazy !
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
hungry . so hungry . there ' s nothing to eat . except this .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
hell no .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
what ' d you do with all the loot ?
three .
not if i can help it .
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
you are fully bonded and licensed by the city , aren ' t you mr . plow ?
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
oh , no .
you had your hot dog plumped ?
ashes to ashes . . . dust to dust . . . we ' ve gotta go fight some robots .
quick gramma , hide !
dad , the bill ' s only a hundred .
oh , i thought i ' d check out the warner brothers network .
da-ad --
what ?
i wanna show you i understand how you feel . and they say a picture ' s worth a thousand words :
i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .
he looks happy .
heeere ' s bart !
indeed i did .
um , i ' ve gotta make a phone call .
is that the only reason ?
dad , don ' t worry , i got you a place .
okay , cat . now , if this works , your next trip will be to the bank vault .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
hey , what smells so good ?
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
hey , what smells so good ?
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
um hm .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
yeah , their guns are right there !
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
can i ?
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
amen .
milhouse abandoned me .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
oh , man .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
you could be my father figure .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
you mean like we just did ?
what about my birthday party ?
can i ?
you c ' mere a minute .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
what are you talking about ?
you mean more popular but not as good ?
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
i need this candy for school .
it ' s gone .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
an elephant ' s butt ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
ow ! !
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
what an odd thing to say .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
hit the road , " welcome home . "
i ' m under thirty .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
mom , is that true ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
do shut up ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
you can ' t make us come down .
wow ! a big ugly head !
paw !
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
where did the ship stop again ?
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
i need this candy for school .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
who ' s in there ?
i could take up smoking .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
oops , my homework !
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
we are home .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
company physical coming up , huh ?
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
do shut up ?
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
that movie ' s for babies .
i could take up smoking .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
company physical coming up , huh ?
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .

i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
ay carumba !
not so tough now , huh ?
nelson took my lunch money again !
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .
i ' ll say . i learned the true meaning of columbus day .
my ex-girlfriends .

nooooo !
what did i do ?
hey look , maggie made you a farewell card .
you bet i do .

i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
i ' m going to get the dog back .
dad , the car !
but dad , my heart hurts .
well his parents aren ' t married , are they ? it ' s the correct word , isn ' t it ?
thanks dad .
dad , only one of them is real .
quick gramma , hide !
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
dad ? it says " non-toxic . "
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
you the man , homer .
did you do those exercises he gave you ?
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
ay carumba !
no belching .
you can always find your favorite shows next month .
listen to yourself , man . you ' re hangin ' with nerds .
all right !
permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
fine .
what about the people on the bottom ?
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
i did .
the last place i saw it . . .
gimme ! i want more !
oh , how come i never get any mail ?
hello ?
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
it ' s crap-tacular .
trying to fix your broken brain .
what about the people on the bottom ?
dad , i ' ll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol ' danish .
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
did you do those exercises he gave you ?
uh , i learned the touch of death .
hey lame ass . thanks to you , we ' re stuck on a stupid therapy boat .
i ' ll just pay the fine .
no , dad , he ' s my friend !
dad , you gotta come . i just got your hat out of the fridge .
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
that ' s fair . sorry . i deserve it . ow , that one really hurt !
for what ?
i love our tuesdays together , dad .
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
how could you have it planned out ? you just heard about the problem .
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
whoa ! they like each other !
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he ' s really awesome !
squealer .
hey , dad .
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "
what the hell are you talkin ' about ? you ' re the one who double dared us .
you ' re the man , homer .
talk what over ? what ' s there to talk about ?

homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .

here you go , dad . i hope you like it . i ' ve forgotten what it is .
incontinent . . . too rich .

dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--
there ' s twelve more boxes . and they all sound the same !

don ' t worry , i don ' t even like using the bathroom after you .
hey , he didn ' t pay the cover !
i believe you , dad .
how come lisa doesn ' t have to play ? why does she get to hang out with her friends ?
dad , do you wear boxers or briefs ?
makes sense to me .
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
so you and mom aren ' t married ? does that mean i ' m a bastard ?
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .
you ' re not welcome .
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
so in a way , we ' d just be balancing out the universe .
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
thanks , dad .
uh , right . do you know what a wet willie is ?
and he taught me how to do this .
oh , this sucks . i want to see vice-president cletus .
huh ?
what ' s it to ya ?
you threw it , you go find it .
thanks , dad .

pound him , dad !
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
does anyone here like food ?
get lost .
not to mention hilarious .
uh . . . we were talking about the time you beat jury duty .
there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !

hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
i love our tuesdays together , dad .
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
why did you make it do that ?
dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--
no . i won ' t .

rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?

" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
who are you talking to , homer ?
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !

good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
our book ! the real one !
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
can i stay with you , dad ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
no me gusto . que lastima .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
what the ?
we ' re on food stamps ?
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .

dad , it-it ' s me !
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .

thanks , pop .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
eh , we could try it .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
mine has a cup holder !
i understand why . you were wasted .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
busted !
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
yuk !
dad , it-it ' s me !
dad ? ! you always hated church !
why would i want a nap ?
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
can i ?
eh , we could try it .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
it ' s your birthday ?
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
christmas .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
yeah , but at least it was short .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
how do you know ?
right , dad .
yes , sir .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
huh ?
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
more like balder and wider .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
but i thought uter took my place .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
dad !
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
hey , dad , something didn ' t get , um , " sorted " .
gimme some nachos , homersaurous .
dad , there ' s a bunch of people in the community outreach center .
we ' ll see .
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
eh .
hey , dad , something didn ' t get , um , " sorted " .
hey , dad . i ' m gonna make a human yo-yo . if you object , clearly say " no " .
throw hot wax on him , dad !
if you really wanted us to be neater , you ' d serve us out of one long bowl .
i ' ve got a partner .
she said " yes . "
uh , dad ? laddie ' s not coming . i gave him away .
hit the road , ya big load !
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
hey , how come lisa gets a pony ?
and who ' s your little school friend ? wait a minute , that ' s mom !
i got my tenure right here .
stop it !
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .
i ' unno . came outta the closet .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
oh !
uh , he didn ' t say science . . . he said " pie pants . "
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
you think so ?
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
wow ! we all have the same scar !
with a virgin tom collins for me ?
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
. . . homer " the human punching bag " simpson . boo ! boo ! hiss !
my ex-girlfriends .
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .
dad , these old stories can ' t compare with our modern super-writers . stephen bochco could kick shakespeare ' s ass .
uh , dad ?
hey , dad , something didn ' t get , um , " sorted " .
don ' t be a sap , dad . these are just crappy knock-offs .
i believe you , dad .
what a sap !
what discussion ?
cool man ! a media circus .
sting !
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
bye forever , milhouse !
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
look at me ! i ' m doin ' something !
homer .
as long as i can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every halloween .
i ' d like to play me latest chart-topper . it ' s called " me fans are stupid pigs . "
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
i never heard of this new hospital so i looked it up and printed it out .
oh .
y ' see ? this is the stuff mom won ' t do with me .
as much as i hate that man right now , you gotta love that suit .
homer .
i like it in the cage . these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress .
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .
hey paris , i saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet . . . your face !
i ' ll just pay the fine .
huh ?
hey , homer , you promised mom you wouldn ' t wear your dress outside .
chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
oh , i thought i ' d check out the warner brothers network .
maybe .
think about it . i mean , what " team " was babe ruth on ? who knows ?
um , i ' ve gotta make a phone call .
cool . this is where jaws eats the boat .
aw , man ! we just missed it .
she said " yes . "
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
maybe laura could watch us .
what ? why ?
just dump ' em in the fire , dad .
there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .
you sure this is a good idea ?
yeah .
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
starting today , we ' re carnies . just like you .

hey , homer , i found your weights .
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .
well , actually . . . i may have accidentally traded a few of those pills , for money . . .
good evening , adults .
dad , only one of them is real .
gross ! weird ! complicated ! go to sleep !
oh !
every day , same old cat . i ' ll make him more interesting .
dad !
dad , you can ' t let him take our dog !
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
uh , nothin ' , pop .
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
yeah , great workmanship .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
beep .
i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
everything .
maybe laura could watch us .
why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
yeah . there ' s just no way to resist it , is there ?
yikes ! what is that ?

mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !

well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
oh , it will not .
so , you fought all those robots ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
tons .
ay carumba !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
but i thought you loved edison .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
. . . dad .
teamwork is overrated .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
eh , we could try it .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
dad , it-it ' s me !
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
that movie ' s for babies .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
but i don ' t hate this country .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
what if she doesn ' t ?
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
cheeky .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
there you go , ratboy .
where are you going ?
homer !
company physical coming up , huh ?
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
dad !
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
tv sucks .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
what about adultery ?
what do you think ?
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
i thought you wanted me to drum !
well . . .
ay carumba !
you c ' mere a minute .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
mom , is that true ?
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
do you want me to watch and learn ?
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
um hm .
because we ' re poor ?
what about adultery ?
sure , why not ?
amen .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
well , don ' t buy ' em !
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
oh , man .
homer !
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
yes , sir .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
what ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
no .
well , time to move on with our lives .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
dad , don ' t worry , i got you a place .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?
krusty versus the f . d . a . . . .
oh , check .
so are we going to the lake or what ?
see ya in the funny pages .
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
in the cart .
hey ! thanks , monkey-man .

whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
i ' ll get the gate .
i am playing in the tournament .
thanks , dad .
dad , no !
sorry , dad . maybe now you ' ll appreciate us . . .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
listen to yourself , man . you ' re hangin ' with nerds .
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
and ?
ay carumba !
i ' m going to get the dog back .
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
dad , look at me ! look at me !
uh , nothin ' , pop .
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
yes sir .
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
what ' d you do with all the loot ?
you ' ll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .
but dr . hibbert said not to stress her out .
you think you ' re better than the great simpsini ? !
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
you did , dad .
yeah .
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
huh -- garbage angels ?
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !
you don ' t have to worship him . he ' s not a god .
we never had a family meeting before .

dad , it ' s may 00th .
squawky ?
i don ' t want to take drugs .
what the hell was that ?
uh , dad ?
oh , can we keep him dad , please ?
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
oh man , now she ' s writing cutesy things with the ribbon .
square as " golden books , " pop .
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
listen to yourself , man . you ' re hangin ' with nerds .
when you ' re gettin ' juiced , can you hold my turtle ? i wanna bring him back to life .
there ' s the rich texan -- and his daughter , paris texan .
come on , dad , just twelve more pounds .
wait , i know . beer here !
no , dad , they ' re the opposite .
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
no , dad , he ' s my friend !
outtasight ! lay it on me , mama .
gimme ! i want more !
dad , look at me ! look at me !
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?
dad , have you seen the girls they have in those contests ? hubba , hubba .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
well , maybe i should .
why didn ' t you wait for me ?
square as " golden books , " pop .
wait a minute . they ' re not so great .
beep .
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .
wow , you ' re right , dad . it is windy .
wasn ' t skipping town in the first place a coward ' s way out ?
aw , come on , dad , be a foodie ! you ' re already a fatty and a drunkie !
hey , mom , can we go see dad put out the fire ?
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
dad !
outtasight ! lay it on me , mama .
dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger .
life is good .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
okay , okay .
i believe you , dad .
dad ?
i love you , dad .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
eh .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
who are beavis and butthead ?
incontinent . . . too rich .
whoa !
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
so ?
i promise .
yeah .
what the hell was that ?
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
they ' ll buy anything !
yeah , this tether has some pluses .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
hey , i call first bedsies !
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
okay , i promise .
he said what now ?
mom , is that true ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
fresh out .
company physical coming up , huh ?
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
it ' s goose !
you could be my father figure .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
but i don ' t hate this country .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
what ? no !
hey !
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
okay , i ' m sold .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
mom , is that true ?
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
right , dad .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
do shut up ?
i can help you .
it ' s your birthday ?
the fat guy on tv ?
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
christmas .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
well , sure you do .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
busted !
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
slurp my snot .
mom .
not so tough now , huh ?
yuk !
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
dad , you barely go to work at all .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
dad !
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
no .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
aw thanks , dad .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
what an odd thing to say .
now that ' s a broken man .
you mean like we just did ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
then what was in the coffin ?
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
busted !
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
oh , man .
i didn ' t take it .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
but i don ' t hate this country .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
teamwork is overrated .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
you mean i can go ?
can i ask you something , dad ?
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .

wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
but i thought you loved edison .
busted !
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
okay , i ' ll try .

dad , you ' re a hero !
no , look ! it ' s a ride that just opened and no one ' s there !

we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
nuh-uh , ' cause we called it .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .

whoa ! yeah , strike three ! you ' re outta there .
i ' m chiquita banana / and i ' m here to say . . .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .

hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
thanks , dad .
come on dad , it ' d be weird .
dad , have you seen the girls they have in those contests ? hubba , hubba .
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
oh .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
cool man ! a media circus .

way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
dad , the mailman is here .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
you have a drinking problem ?
what ? no !
hurry , homer !
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
where are you going ?
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
he said what now ?
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
therapy , please .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
why the hell would i want to see that ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
perish the thought .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
who are you talking to , homer ?
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
then what was in the coffin ?
fat guy number three ?
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
dad ? !
now fly -- to the canary islands !
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
hey , what smells so good ?
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
mom . get him away from the window .
what an odd thing to say .
what about abraham lincoln ?
what about sunday ?
oh , man .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
except a place to live and free food .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
now that ' s a broken man .
oh , it will not .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
wow ! a big ugly head !
does something smell funny in here ?
what ? no !
you spent all the money i earned ? !
oh , it will not .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
where are you really going ?
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
no .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
perish the thought .
ay carumba !
huh ?
teamwork is overrated .
oh , okay .
what are you talking about ?
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
well , no .
can i ?
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
right , dad .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
krusty !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
mine has a cup holder !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
what ? no !
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
what happened ?
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
what about adultery ?
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
our book ! the real one !
no , i ' m not . i suck .
right , dad .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
thanks , pop .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
what are you talking about ?
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
what happened ?
where are you really going ?
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
teamwork is overrated .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
it ' s goose !
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
how do you know ?
foxy boxing ?
why the hell would i want to see that ?
i concur .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
paw !
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
who ' s in there ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
yeah .
. . . dad .
and how .
okay , i promise .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
bart simpson , at your service .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
you can ' t make us come down .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
i need this candy for school .
dad ? !
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
who ' s in there ?
mom . get him away from the window .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
oh , okay .
yeah !
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
the fat guy on tv ?

hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
. . . dad .
right , dad .
aw , come on .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .

then what was in the coffin ?
hullo ?
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
you c ' mere a minute .

people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
teamwork is overrated .
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
i already do that .
oh , yeah .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .

those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
again ! again !
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .

dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
i ' ve kissed three girls .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
why don ' t you buy it ?
and how .

hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .

hey , that ' s my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated , eight-fold , fourteen-gauge box .
aw , man ! we just missed it .
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
dad , there ' s a bunch of people in the community outreach center .
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .

that ' s not you . they just painted shrek yellow .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .

homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !

dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
y ' see ? this is the stuff mom won ' t do with me .

we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .

i sure hope not .
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .

ay carumba !
wow ! you are so much cooler than milhouse ' s mom .
um , dad . . .
people . i guess they thought i was a charity case .
does it matter ?
no .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
i was faking it .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
sure you were , rummy .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
company physical coming up , huh ?
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
i want to watch krusty .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
aw , come on .
i suppose .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
aw , come on .
hit the road , " welcome home . "
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
huh ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
hit the road , " welcome home . "
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
foxy boxing ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
homer !
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i need this candy for school .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
aw , come on .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
anything slim !
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .

thanks , pop .

you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
can i ?
dad , it-it ' s me !
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
aw , come on .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
mom . get him away from the window .
amen , brother .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
ay carumba !
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
huh ?
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
no , i ' m not . i suck .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
really , dad ?
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
what are you talking about ?
don ' t give up , dad .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
where are you really going ?
it ' s a deal .
what ? no !
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
who ' s in there ?
there ' s no denying it , sis .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
oh , yeah .
mount kilimanjaro ?
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
what about sunday ?
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
that movie ' s for babies .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
what about abraham lincoln ?
no me gusto . que lastima .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
we ' re out of waffles .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
i was faking it .
we know , dad . we were there .
you have a drinking problem ?
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
where are you going ?
dad ? !
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
ow ! !
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
i could take up smoking .
yeah !
oh , okay .
cheeky .
you can ' t make us come down .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
wow ! a big ugly head !
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
tons .
aw , dad .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
uh-oh . school bus .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
we ' re on food stamps ?
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
amen , brother .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
what an odd thing to say .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
no reason . brother .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
the fat guy on tv ?
more like balder and wider .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
it ' s gone .
dad , the plan !
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
thanks , pop .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
wow ! a big ugly head !
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
teamwork is overrated .
right .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
amen .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
you mean i can go ?
and how .
i concur .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
no .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
i ' m under thirty .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
ay carumba !
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
what an odd thing to say .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
oh , yeah .
teamwork is overrated .
slurp my snot .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
why would i want a nap ?
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
but dad . . .
yeah .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
well , no .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
it ' s your birthday ?
oh , man .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
but i thought uter took my place .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
i like it in the cage . these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress .
trying to fix your broken brain .
ow ! quit it . it used to be a real boss tattoo .
yeah , i ' d like to speak to a mr . tabooger . first name , ollie .

excellent .
you had your hot dog plumped ?
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
hey , dad . . . what if we . . .

are you kidding ? i reeked !
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .

you ' re the man , homer .
i wanna show you i understand how you feel . and they say a picture ' s worth a thousand words :
uh , dad . . .
hm . " thanks for letting us crash in your pad . we had a very nice time . "
dad ! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g !
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .

except a place to live and free food .
you ' re the boss .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !

well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .

he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
well , i wish homer was here .
oh , yeah .
that movie ' s for babies .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
okay , i ' m sold .

dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
why ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
you could be my father figure .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
i can help you .
mount kilimanjaro ?
skinner didn ' t let me go .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
no reason . brother .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
sure you were , rummy .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
i could take up smoking .
you can ' t make us come down .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
amen .
so , you fought all those robots ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
i suppose .
well , no .
you mean i can go ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
why the hell would i want to see that ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
because we ' re poor ?
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
your electric hammer , maestro ?
oops , my homework !
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
what ?
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
do shut up ?
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
right , dad .
what do you think ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
you have a drinking problem ?
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
i suppose .
okay , i ' m sold .
no reason . brother .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
you have a drinking problem ?
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
what ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
eh , we could try it .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
what if she doesn ' t ?
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
dad !
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
anything slim !
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
the nineties ? never heard of it .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
there you go , ratboy .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
mine has a cup holder !
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
aw , come on .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
can i have a beer ?
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
oh , man .
it ' s goose !
c ' mon , dad . i gotta go to the bathroom .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
thanks , dad .

mom , do you have any idea how i got this scar ?
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !

bob ' s playing all of you like saps . this man ' s a killer !
hell , yes .
cowabunga , dude !
homer .
why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
they have it now .
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
you ' re not welcome .
i ' m chiquita banana / and i ' m here to say . . .
hey dad , why don ' t we watch you drink from a hose ?
uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
we tricked you ! / eat nerf , homeboy !
i got my tenure right here .
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
gotta hide .
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .
yeah .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .
what ' s it to ya ?
the store detective !
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
how could you have it planned out ? you just heard about the problem .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .
beep .
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .
maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .
uh-huh . bet he used bait , too .
makes sense to me .
i had a run-in with a bully .
there you go . . thanks for comin ' out . . .
krusty versus the f . d . a . . . .
thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . too thin .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .
i ' ll just pay the fine .
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !
. . . so from now on , all hats are banned from the school .
it ' s okay dad , i can fill in for nelson .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
i ' ll get to it when i get to it .
it doesn ' t sound very tractor-y .
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he ' s really awesome !
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
dad ! we don ' t watch that show anymore !
uh . . . we were talking about the time you beat jury duty .
hey , you guys want a lift in my pedal boat ?
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
aww . and someday you ' ll be one too .
well , you did disappear a lot , but i have gone whole summers without seeing you .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
well , just this week , there ' s been field day , picking me up from the airport . . .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
will i ever play baseball again ?
sorry , dad . maybe now you ' ll appreciate us . . .
aren ' t those full of germs ?
see ya in the funny pages .
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
you know , it might ' ve been jimbo .
i ' unno . came outta the closet .
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
good for you . no more drinkin ' ?
krusty versus the f . d . a . . . .
what about the people on the bottom ?
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
what are you planting ?
it ' s crap-tacular .
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
i like the beat -- play me the tune .
huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .
yes sir !
it ' s mergatronic , daddy-ho .
hang on , dad , this next part ' ll definitely make you feel better about yourself .

i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
locusts . they ' ll drive him nuts .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !

hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .

hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
come on dad , it ' d be weird .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .

yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
i like it in the cage . these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress .
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
oh , papa .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .

are you kidding ? he ' s my idol . i ' ve based my whole life on krusty ' s teachings .
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
oh , yeah .
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
huh ?
dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
hey ! / ay carumba !
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !
yeah , i ' d like to speak to a mr . tabooger . first name , ollie .
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
yeah . he invented stuff , too .
and ?
heeere ' s bart !
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
simp-son ! ! ! where ' s my dinner ? !
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
all right , man . you asked for it . no more mr . nice guy .
fine . take it .
that ' s fair . sorry . i deserve it . ow , that one really hurt !
whatcha doin ' , mom ? goin ' crazy ?

that ' s fair . sorry . i deserve it . ow , that one really hurt !
no , i mean the mailman ' s here .
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
hey , what smells so good ?
homer !
we ' ve seen it , dad .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
hullo ?
dad , the mailman is here .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
who ' s in there ?
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
thanks , dad .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
can i ask you something , dad ?
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
not so tough now , huh ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
cheeky .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
well , no .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
i already do that .
yuk !
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
put it in the bank .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
we are home .
more like balder and wider .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
well , sure you do .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
hurry , homer !
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
well , don ' t buy ' em !
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
mom .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
krusty !
does something smell funny in here ?
what about my birthday party ?
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
dad ? !
well , no .
ay carumba !
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
no .
i can help you .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
we are home .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
all righty !
sure , why not ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
that movie ' s for babies .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
right , dad .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
ow ! !
huh ?
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
cool !
look , that ' s our ship !
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
yes , sir !
hullo ?
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
nice try , homer .
i need this candy for school .
well , you told her , dad .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
mount kilimanjaro ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
huh ?
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
what if someone catches him ?
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
cowabunga , dude !
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
whoa , it ' s santa , all right ! and he is kickin ' ass !
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
hey , dad .
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
for what ?
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
dad , don ' t be a credit hog
huh ?
sorry , i ' ve got a baseball game in fifteen minutes .
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
dad , it ' s may 00th .
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
well , i ' m keeping this earring and you can ' t stop me !
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .
homer .
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
i ' m going to get the dog back .
hell , yes .
i ' ll say . i learned the true meaning of columbus day .
whoa !
what ' s a chachi ?
way to go , dad !
read to lisa ? why don ' t you just ask me to kiss her ?
oh , no .
oh , this sucks . i want to see vice-president cletus .
what ' s with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?
and he said if we went to the cops , he ' d come back for maggie .
lethal inject her on the electric chair !
well , there ' s krusty , itchy , scratchy , poochie , america ' s firefighters and then you , dad .
i ' ll get to it when i get to it .
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
oh , no .
i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
fine .
i guess .
homer .
not bloody likely .
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .
krusty versus the f . d . a . . . .
blast that infernal card ! don ' t give that card to me .
chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
i liked it when it was me , mom and homer . you wrecked everything . i ' m leaving . goodbye .
no time .

correction : finished manuscript .

dad ! we don ' t watch that show anymore !
uh . . . toys ?

dad , whatever you say , you know you will always have my love and respect .
uh , he didn ' t say science . . . he said " pie pants . "

y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .
they ' ll buy anything !

huh ?
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
dad !
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
who ' s in there ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
oh , yeah .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
dad , how drunk are you ?
but she might say no .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
do shut up ?
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
fat guy number three ?
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
you c ' mere a minute .
the fat guy on tv ?
why ?
you got it .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
right , dad .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
it ' s gone .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
sure , why not ?
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
agreed .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
cool man !
you have a drinking problem ?
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
why ?
gotcha . well , gotta go .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i ' m under thirty .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
can i ?
wow , i never thought of it like that .
more like the " expandables " !
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
no , we need to sail !
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
no .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
uh-oh . school bus .
what about adultery ?
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
oh , okay .
okay , i promise .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
dad , it-it ' s me !
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
yes , sir .
amen .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
eh , we could try it .
amen .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
what if she doesn ' t ?
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
tons .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
oh , yeah .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
yes , sir .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
tell it , daddy !
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
yeah .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
amen .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
put it in the bank .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .

i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
gotcha . well , gotta go .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
no reason . brother .
amen .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !

homer , you ate their jerky .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !

hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
i didn ' t take it .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .

i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .

i ' ll dig an outhouse .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .

homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
can i have a beer ?

people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
does something smell funny in here ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .

wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .

dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !

look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .

but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
yeah !
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
i want to watch krusty .

oh , lemme go with you , dad !
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?

dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
i ' m just mad all the time .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
well , you told her , dad .
i could take up smoking .
dad , it-it ' s me !
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
gotcha . well , gotta go .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
it ' s gone .
teamwork is overrated .
thanks , pop .
who ' s in there ?
no , we need to sail !
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
but she might say no .
yuk !
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
wait , dad , look !
why ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
tell it , daddy !
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
all righty !
okay , i promise .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
. . . dad .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
you ' re the boss .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
i could take up smoking .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
what ' s his problem ?
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
can i , for true ?
are you guys fighting over us ?
stop it !
you can always find your favorite shows next month .
aren ' t those full of germs ?
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .
hurry up , dad !
i don ' t want to take drugs .
he ' s damn opposed ! damn ! damn ! damn opposed !
dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . thinner . . . too thin .
dad , thanks to television , i can ' t remember what happened eight minutes ago .
you didn ' t do anything .
dad , the car !
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
wait , i know . beer here !
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
i ' m on it .
dad ! we don ' t watch that show anymore !
these games are so old . who got these high scores ? pilgrims ? hmm , never saw this one before .
looks like you lost the patient , doc .
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
this is so humiliating .
square as " golden books , " pop .
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
let ' s get this show on the road , man . we got things to do .

correction : finished manuscript .
if edison thought of that chair , how come it ' s not on this chart ?
hey , homer . this house sucks .

what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
i ' ll save you !
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
here you go . enjoy .
dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .
it ' s on the back of our vests .
you did , dad .
not if i can help it .
oh please , dad . i want this more than anything in the world .
put him down , boy ! put him down !
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
building a soap box derby racer .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .

no .
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
yay !
no sir , i didn ' t .
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
thanks , dad . sure you ' re not gonna be bored ?
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
so in a way , we ' d just be balancing out the universe .
you ' re up to something , aren ' t you ?
dad , i promise i ' ll be good .
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?

remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
yes it does .
cool . mr . flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .
think about it . i mean , what " team " was babe ruth on ? who knows ?
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?

good for you . no more drinkin ' ?
beep .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
no .

nelson ' s a great quarterback . he ' s carryin ' this team !
they took the bait . let ' s go .
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
maybe .
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
we ' re all proud of you , dad .
this is so humiliating .
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
aw , that ' s my krusty . i got a feeling he ' ll be allll-right .
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .

talk what over ? what ' s there to talk about ?
what the hell was that ?
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
are you kidding ? i reeked !
oh , papa .
like what ? they ' ll do something with you that they hate ?
he ' s trained to do all sorts of stuff . he can herd sheep and perform cpr .
no , not really .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
hell no .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
sorry , dad . maybe now you ' ll appreciate us . . .
and for the college-bound . . . 000 stay-alert capsules .

dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
there ' s twelve more boxes . and they all sound the same !
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
as much as i hate that man right now , you gotta love that suit .
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
is uncle fester still alive ?
you bet i do .
yeah , homer .
i am playing in the tournament .

is that true ?
give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .

eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .

i ' m just mad all the time .
wow ! a big ugly head !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .

are you sure that thing could really explode ?
all righty !
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .

dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
mom , is that true ?
amen .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
all righty !
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
thanks , pop .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
well , sure you do .
mount kilimanjaro ?

hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
aw , dad .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i can help you .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .

dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
therapy , please .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
should i get my helmet ?

chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?

makes sense to me .
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
all right !
it ' s okay dad , i can fill in for nelson .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
yes !
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
gee , sorry for being born .

dad , look who ' s in there !
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .

i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
paw !
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
do shut up ?
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
all right !
a real swiss army knife . cool !
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
how do you know ?
amen .
it ' s goose !
let ' s never miss the school bus again .

what happened ?
thanks , pop .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
we know , dad . we were there .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
yeah !
hey !
what ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
ay carumba !
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
except a place to live and free food .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
oh , man .
you can ' t make us come down .
well , sure you do .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
fresh out .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
work that body , homer .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?

well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
amen , brother .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
huh ?
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
really , dad ?
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
dad , the plan !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
yes , sir .
tons .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
he said what now ?
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
i guess it ' s possible .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .

i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
tell it , daddy !
well . . .
should i get my helmet ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
amen .
thanks , pop .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
where are you going ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !

i love you too , dad .
hey , dad . " do you hear voices ? "
mom ' s not gonna like this .
it ' s our favorite show !
i need a hundred dollars for a comic book .
i bought this cool pencil holder .
when do i get a krusty suitcase ?
i know a web site that shows monkeys doin ' it .
give up , homeboy . there ' s a six-stroke limit .
put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet !
okay , first i ' ll send down my shoes .
what do we do , dad ?
dad , your hands feel so soft .
it was like that when i got here .
hey , who ' s the moptop with the big schnozz ?
uh-oh .
is the nest still warm enough , mom ?
i thought we had enough money for a good tree .
in about two seconds .
got your wallet .
you shut up .
correction . it ' s worth ten times as much .
. . . as i was shoving it into the mailbox .
wow ! how many home runs you gonna hit with that ?
it ain ' t over till the fat lady sings .
which old witch ?
dad , no ! think of the bike .
then you explain that .
yes ! and i ' ve got gum on my shoe !
nothing should .
i wanna stay here with mr . burns .
well , here . say something .
april f . . .
i never noticed .
that ' s great , dad .

the hot dog water ' s gonna push us into the fan !
don ' t worry , here ' s the cash .
is that a real thing ?
okay , right after dinner , it ' s down to business .
oh , it will not .
should i get my helmet ?
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
ay carumba !
agreed .
oh , it will not .
well , no .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
sure you were , rummy .
paw !
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
right , dad .
i guess it ' s possible .
dad !
dad , it-it ' s me !
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
yeah , their guns are right there !
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
i ' ll supervise .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
and how .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
amen .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
no .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
now !
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
well , you told her , dad .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
an elephant ' s butt ?
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
hey , i call first bedsies !
thanks , pop .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
why would i want a nap ?
well , sure you do .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
yuk !
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
thanks , pop .
more like balder and wider .
therapy , please .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
there you go , ratboy .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
paw !
amen .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
okay .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
you could be my father figure .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
you ' re the boss .
how do you know ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
can i ?
okay , i promise .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
nice try , homer .
what about my birthday party ?
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
why would i want a nap ?
where did the ship stop again ?
i can help you .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
company physical coming up , huh ?
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
no reason . brother .

how come lisa doesn ' t have to play ? why does she get to hang out with her friends ?
whoa careful , dad . blow a gasket and you lose your job .

a real preacher knows how to bring the bible alive through music and dancing and tae-bo !

ay carumba !

chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
squealer .

but dad , my heart hurts .
i can have all my birthday parties in it !
yes . " are you quick to anger ? "
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
are you guys fighting over us ?
pardon me for asking , but where the hell ' s my stupid lobster ?
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
are you kidding ? he ' s my idol . i ' ve based my whole life on krusty ' s teachings .
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .

dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
no , wait . i have a plan . but i ' ll need your underpants .
dad . . .
reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !
nuh-uh , ' cause we called it .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
no i didn ' t , dad .
hey , that ' s my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated , eight-fold , fourteen-gauge box .
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
can i , for true ?
let ' s get this show on the road , man . we got things to do .
hmmm . . . should i . . . or shouldn ' t i . . .
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .
think you ' ll win ?
what about the people on the bottom ?
i believe you , dad .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
pay the man , homer .
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
nooooo !
he did ?
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
who ' s gonna eat my homework now ?
dad , thanks to television , i can ' t remember what happened eight minutes ago .
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
oh !
can i burn evidence in it ?
now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it .
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
he did ?
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
dad . dad ! you really want to get rid of this trampoline ?
dad , who ' s watching tv at 0 : 00 a . m . ?
it ' s just forks and plates . didn ' t we bring any food ?
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .
yes !
the store detective !
i ' ll just pay the fine .
not if i can help it .
oh , check .
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .
i think he left a " big hug " in your lunch box .
wait a minute . they ' re not so great .
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
and play !
uh oh .
unky herb , what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself ?
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he ' s really awesome !
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
oh yeah ? they made you build this statue .
it ' s over there , nelson .
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
well , me and milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer .
whoa ! yeah , strike three ! you ' re outta there .
aye carumba !
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
the flanders are a buncha geeks , man .
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
man , that ' s some story .
he was driving me crazy so i sent him on an errand .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
mom . get him away from the window .
eh , we could try it .
bart simpson , at your service .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
fat guy number three ?
i ' ll supervise .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
you ' re the boss .
oh , man .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
what about my birthday party ?
teamwork is overrated .
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
therapy , please .
dad !
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
you got it .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
dad , the mailman is here .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
what happened ?
aw , dad .
i ' ll supervise .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .

well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
eh , we could try it .
ay carumba !
it ' s gone .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
sure , why not ?
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
what about abraham lincoln ?
krusty !
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
what an odd thing to say .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
we know , dad . we were there .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
krusty !
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
we ' ve seen it , dad .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
nice try , homer .
but dad . . .
where did the ship stop again ?
aw thanks , dad .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
now !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
more like the " expandables " !

how ' bout the disney minority program ?
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
bart simpson , at your service .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
it ' s gone .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
perish the thought .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
uh-oh . school bus .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
hey , i call first bedsies !
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
there you go , ratboy .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
you c ' mere a minute .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
yes , sir !
i concur .
uh-oh . school bus .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
what an odd thing to say .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
now that ' s a broken man .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
mom .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
huh ?
we ' ll see .
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
this won ' t even cover the vig on what i owe !
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
what ' s that ? a home-made bat ?
no , but . . .
what are you doing ?
they ' re not mine . my boss said his warehouse was full .
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .

lisa it ' s your birthday /

la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
just one , and it ' s across town .
hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
well , that ' s great , dad , except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
if you call this living .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
life is good .
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
uh , dad ? laddie ' s not coming . i gave him away .
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
i ' ll save you !
homer !
give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
yeah , homer .
life is good .
hey paris , i saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet . . . your face !
no . i won ' t .

mrs . krabappel , i ' m done failing the test . can i please go to the nurse ?
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .
oh , yeah .
yes , sir .
if you call this living .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
wild , bushy hair , like an animal .
here you go . enjoy .
this is for love , dad . someday you ' ll feel what i feel .
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
sting !
when you ' re gettin ' juiced , can you hold my turtle ? i wanna bring him back to life .
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
uh-huh .
really ?
and ?
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
well , dad , here ' s my report card . i think you ' ll be pleasantly surprised .
hey , homer ! check it out !
c ' mon , dad . i gotta go to the bathroom .
fine .
dad , you can ' t eat all those free samples . we ' ve got to get lisa ' s present .
just one , and it ' s across town .
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
wow , you ' re right , dad . it is windy .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .
um , hey , dad , i , i think he wants a . . .
no , dad , they ' re the opposite .
hurry up , dad !

you ' ll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .
okay . rub a dub dub , thanks for the grub .
dad , the bill ' s only a hundred .
life is good .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
dad ' s been doing that for two hours !
any thoughts on how we ' re gonna get there ?
ah , dad , if just me , milhouse and lewis had voted . . .
he ' s trained to do all sorts of stuff . he can herd sheep and perform cpr .
nelson ' s a great quarterback . he ' s carryin ' this team !
it ' s over there , nelson .
unky herb , what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself ?
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
all right , the personals ! hmm . hm-hm-hm . " successful mayor-type seeks open-minded , discreet cheerleader-type . "
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
uh-huh .
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
it ' s eight in the morning !
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
well , that ' s great , dad , except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper .
i don ' t know , dad . what if she ' s still mad at me ?
lisa ! dad ! c ' mere quick ! there is something that you won ' t believe !
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger .
dad , wait . you ' re not risking your life just to impress me , are you ?
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?
one stinkin ' letter ? why ' d you make us gather ' round like that ?
it ' s the first day of school .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
any thoughts on how we ' re gonna get there ?
uh , dad . . .
wow , look at all this loot ! what should we buy first ?
let ' s go to the sharper image . they ' ve got a tv shaped like a fifties diner !
okay , cat . now , if this works , your next trip will be to the bank vault .
hey , he didn ' t pay the cover !
starting today , we ' re carnies . just like you .
uh . . . toys ?
are you still talking about the earth ?
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
can i stay with you , dad ?
why would i want a nap ?
we ' re out of waffles .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
what the ?
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
huh ?
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
testify !
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
wow ! a big ugly head !
mom , is that true ?
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
you got it .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
. . . dad .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
amen , brother .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
oh , it will not .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
where are you going ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
milhouse abandoned me .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .

not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !

buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
amen .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
what about adultery ?
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
oh , man .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
more like balder and wider .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
i didn ' t take it .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
yeah !
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .

yes !
homer .
ashes to ashes . . . dust to dust . . . we ' ve gotta go fight some robots .
does anyone here like food ?
well , okay , dad . i promise . i will not jump springfield gorge .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .

maybe .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
oh , go for it , dad .
you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
anything slim !
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
skinner didn ' t let me go .
nice try , homer .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
okay .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
except a place to live and free food .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
why would i want a nap ?
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
cool !
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
huh ?
does something smell funny in here ?
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
what if someone catches him ?
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
yes , sir !
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
huh ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
dad , how drunk are you ?
tell it , daddy !
all righty !
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
i already do that .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
choose your corncob ! en garde !
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
hey , everybody . look what we got !
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
i ' m bart .
what if she doesn ' t ?
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
dad , the plan !
right , dad .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
i didn ' t take it .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
christmas .
therapy , please .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
oh , it will not .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
and how .
not so tough now , huh ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
where are you really going ?
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
oh , man .
dad ? !
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
where are you going ?
skinner didn ' t let me go .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
but i thought uter took my place .
ay carumba !
you got it .
you mean like we just did ?
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
the fat guy on tv ?
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
christmas .
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
so what if i am ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
there ' s no denying it , sis .
therapy , please .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
i already do that .
oops , my homework !
hey , check it out !
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
dad !
i ' ll supervise .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
put it in the bank .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
next .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
we ' re out of waffles .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
eh , we could try it .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
next .
you could be my father figure .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
can i ask you something , dad ?
eh , we could try it .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
i need this candy for school .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
okay , i promise .
put it in the bank .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
well , yeah , but --
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
oh , man .

therapy , please .
no .
krusty !
do shut up ?
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
yes , sir .
why would i want a nap ?
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
not so tough now , huh ?
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
christmas .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
thanks , pop .
no , we need to sail !
. . . dad .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
dad , the mailman is here .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
gotcha . well , gotta go .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
dad !
where are you going ?
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .

dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
oops , my homework !
that movie ' s for babies .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
company physical coming up , huh ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
what ?
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
anything slim !
more like balder and wider .
bart simpson , at your service .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !

not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
ay carumba !

no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
um hm .
next .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .

dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--
gee , sorry for being born .

we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
hey , let ' s see if dad ' s song is finally off the air .
dad , i ' ll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol ' danish .
. . . so from now on , all hats are banned from the school .

oh , yeah .
alaska !

who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .

church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?

do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .

we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
you could be my father figure .
gotcha . well , gotta go .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
eh , we could try it .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
testify !
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .

milhouse abandoned me .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
who are you talking to , homer ?
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
amen .
milhouse abandoned me .
who ' s in there ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
you think so ?
it ' s your birthday ?
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
right , dad .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
how ' d you know that thing would work ?
some bullies beat me up and took it .
which one ? homer or fat ass ?
os-os .

we ' re watching the tv .
ow ! there ' s a big box in here !
let it go , dad .
then you explain that .
i just got started !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
except a place to live and free food .
hullo ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
so , you fought all those robots ?
aw , dad .
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
nice try , homer .
what happened ?
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
krusty !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
really , dad ?
dad , how drunk are you ?
wow , i never thought of it like that .
sure , why not ?
mom .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
it ' s your birthday ?
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
foxy boxing ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
i was faking it .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
what do you think ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
cheeky .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
hey , i call first bedsies !
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
teamwork is overrated .
more like the " expandables " !
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
hullo ?
hey !
nice try , homer .
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
i ' m just mad all the time .
but i thought you loved edison .
oops , my homework !
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
so , you fought all those robots ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
mount kilimanjaro ?
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
yeah !
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
all right !
paw !
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
you mean like we just did ?
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
what an odd thing to say .
i ' ll supervise .
nice try , homer .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
where are you really going ?
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
he said what now ?
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
i ' m bart .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
next .
did you check your pocket ?
you mean i can go ?
agreed .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
an elephant ' s butt ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
no me gusto . que lastima .
what about my birthday party ?
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
it ' s goose !
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
but she might say no .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
oops , my homework !
now fly -- to the canary islands !
what the ?
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
well , don ' t buy ' em !
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
put it in the bank .
mount kilimanjaro ?
now !
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
yes , sir .
oh , man .
oh , man .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
can i ?
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
mom .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
what about adultery ?
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
yes , sir !
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
. . . dad .
where are you going ?
no me gusto . que lastima .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
aw thanks , dad .
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
dad , the mailman is here .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
oh , it will not .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
yes , sir .
it ' s goose !
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
busted !
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
sure , why not ?
um hm .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
cheeky .
mom . get him away from the window .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
all righty !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
why ?
thanks , dad .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
. . . dad .
aw , dad .
i concur .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
do shut up ?
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
slurp my snot .
teamwork is overrated .

look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
christmas .
what about adultery ?
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
what ? no !
next .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
why don ' t you buy it ?
foxy boxing ?
what a dump !
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
dad , the mailman is here .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
. . . dad .
company physical coming up , huh ?
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
do shut up ?
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
next .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
more like the " expandables " !
you mean i can go ?
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
can i stay with you , dad ?
where did the ship stop again ?
hey , look , another spaceship !
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
okay .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
does something smell funny in here ?
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
huh ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
dad , you barely go to work at all .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
there you go , ratboy .
hey , check it out !
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
slurp my snot .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
you have a drinking problem ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
cool !
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
except a place to live and free food .
you can ' t make us come down .
teamwork is overrated .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
fat guy number three ?
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
well , no .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
do shut up ?
well . . .
i didn ' t take it .
aw , dad .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
okay .
you could be my father figure .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
who ' s in there ?
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
what about sunday ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
i thought it was chocolate milk !
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
what if someone catches him ?
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
mom , is that true ?
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
well , i wish homer was here .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
dad !
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
but i don ' t hate this country .
wait , dad , look !
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
it ' s gone .
what about my birthday party ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
huh ?
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
all right !
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
cool man !
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?
you threw it , you go find it .
yeah , this tether has some pluses .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !
yeah , i ' d like to speak to a mr . tabooger . first name , ollie .
cowabunga , dude !
maybe .
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
shaddap !
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
beer ! beer is the cheese . but how to use it . . .
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
d ' unno . why are your friends such drunks ?
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
dad , there ' s a bunch of people in the community outreach center .
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
yep .
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by " taking care of something ? "
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
yeah , homer .
they ' ll buy anything !
hey lame ass . thanks to you , we ' re stuck on a stupid therapy boat .
it ' s just forks and plates . didn ' t we bring any food ?
fine . take it .
yeah , dad ! you ' re a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
homer .

hey , how come lisa gets a pony ?
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "

i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .
she said " yes . "
what ' s a chachi ?
indeed i did .
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
i never heard of this new hospital so i looked it up and printed it out .
quiet , dad , or we ' ll have to throw you outta here .
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
his house ?
says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring .
a real preacher knows how to bring the bible alive through music and dancing and tae-bo !
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
i wanna show you i understand how you feel . and they say a picture ' s worth a thousand words :
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
homer !
put him down , boy ! put him down !
and ?
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .
aye carumba !
yes . " are you quick to anger ? "
pound him , dad !
seriously dad , i ' m worried . you should go on a diet .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .

hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
got it .
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .

after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
dad , don ' t be a credit hog
gross ! weird ! complicated ! go to sleep !
hm . " thanks for letting us crash in your pad . we had a very nice time . "

what ' s this notice on the wall ?
yeah , thanks a lot , flanders .
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .

i ' m on it .
hm . " thanks for letting us crash in your pad . we had a very nice time . "
dad , look who ' s in there !
it ' s crap-tacular .
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .
wasn ' t skipping town in the first place a coward ' s way out ?

huh -- garbage angels ?
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
not bloody likely .
all right , man . you asked for it . no more mr . nice guy .
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
you the man , homer .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
not bloody likely .
dad , that line was in the cartoon .
uh , nothin ' , pop .

homer ?
oh , go for it , dad .
wow , you ' re right , dad . it is windy .
dad , i ' m asking if i can get a job .

wow , dad . you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl ?
ashes to ashes . . . dust to dust . . . we ' ve gotta go fight some robots .
well , leaving right now will become a special memory for me .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
yeah .
yeah , thanks a lot , flanders .
he hit us !
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
yeah , and a good dad wouldn ' t miss his son ' s little league games !
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .

i ' ll do it this afternoon . . .
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !

" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "

hey !
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
i need this candy for school .

that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
does something smell funny in here ?
you ' re the boss .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
what a dump !
and how .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
dad , the mailman is here .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
fresh out .
what ?
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
should i get my helmet ?
well , yeah , but --
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
why would i want a nap ?
what about sunday ?
it ' s a deal .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
amen .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
dad , it-it ' s me !
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
oh , man .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
i ' m bart .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
mom , is that true ?
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
tv sucks .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
because we ' re poor ?
krusty !
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
company physical coming up , huh ?
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
cool !
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
it ' s your birthday ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
no me gusto . que lastima .
you got it .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
i want to watch krusty .
homer , you ate their jerky .
okay .
tons .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
go for it .
mount kilimanjaro ?
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
what are you talking about ?
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
i need this candy for school .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
paw !
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
well , i wish homer was here .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
go for it .
not so tough now , huh ?
why don ' t you buy it ?
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
what if someone catches him ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
testify !
dad ? !
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
uh-oh . school bus .
fresh out .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
i can help you .
what happened ?
i already do that .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
i ' ll supervise .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
we ' re out of waffles .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
why ?
cool !
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
homer , you ate their jerky .
dad , how drunk are you ?
it ' s a deal .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
anything slim !
but she might say no .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
no .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
hey , i call first bedsies !
amen .
dad , the plan !
so what if i am ?
because we ' re poor ?
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
i need this candy for school .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
what about adultery ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
not so tough now , huh ?
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
what ? no !
i already do that .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
perish the thought .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
tv sucks .
hullo ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
well , no .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
i concur .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
mount kilimanjaro ?
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
oh , okay .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .

what if she doesn ' t ?
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .

that movie ' s for babies .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
does something smell funny in here ?
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
what ? no !

you ' re up to something , aren ' t you ?
oh how do i know this isn ' t some beautiful dream , too ?
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
no , things rich people buy , like campbell ' s soup and pepsodent .
i don ' t know . . . fleecin ' old people ?
hell , yes .
big deal . i don ' t like girls either .
i ' ve got a partner .
dad , do you wear boxers or briefs ?
dad , you gotta come . i just got your hat out of the fridge .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
i don ' t love you either . so give me a moped .
you ' re stifling my creativity , dad .
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
oh , please ! this is senseless destruction , with none of my usual social commentary .
what discussion ?
thanks for trying , guys , but sideshow bob wants me dead , and sideshow bob is an unstoppable killing machine .
are you still talking about the earth ?
and he taught me how to do this .
wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
why are we still grifting ? the car ' s paid for . doesn ' t that balance out the universe ?
you think so ?
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
oh , okay .
are you nuts ?
trick-or-treat ! lick my feet ! your head smells like pig-butt meat !
think about it . i mean , what " team " was babe ruth on ? who knows ?
yes sir !
c ' mon , dad ! the team ' s arriving !
hey , what gives ?
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
and for the college-bound . . . 000 stay-alert capsules .
dad , do you wear boxers or briefs ?
yeah , mom says a lot of things .
a zephyr ?
thanks for trying , guys , but sideshow bob wants me dead , and sideshow bob is an unstoppable killing machine .
it ' s over there , nelson .
nice use of the lingo , homer .
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
dad , the car !
i ' ll save you !
well , there ' s krusty , itchy , scratchy , poochie , america ' s firefighters and then you , dad .
i didn ' t do anything .
what ' s a chachi ?
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
all night . you were yelling at the swing .
i love you , dad .
huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
dad , look at me ! look at me !
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
dad , don ' t take this wrong , but your expression doesn ' t fill me with confidence .
but i want to see it !
/ get your hands off of me , you fat ass--
well . . . i was wondering . . . how important is it to be popular ?
nelson took my lunch money again !
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
dad , over here !
this is so humiliating .
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
i ' m bart simpson . who the hell are you ?
really ? ! oh , how terrible !
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself .
oh , so many wasted nights . . .
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
crank it , homer .
yeah . there ' s just no way to resist it , is there ?
dad ?
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
mom ! dad ! i saw sideshow bob and he threatened to kill me !
it ' s the first day of school .
dad , whatever you say , you know you will always have my love and respect .
then i ' ll have been on every continent .
hey , dad .
yeah ! let ' s go skiing ! / yeah , dad . let ' s go !
thanks dad .
it ' s the first day of school .
not bloody likely .
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .
what ' s wrong ?
huh -- garbage angels ?
dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .
you didn ' t do anything .
you didn ' t do anything .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
whoa , it ' s santa , all right ! and he is kickin ' ass !
you didn ' t do anything .
don ' t be a sap , dad . these are just crappy knock-offs .
wild , bushy hair , like an animal .
i don ' t love you either . so give me a moped .
we never had a family meeting before .
uh oh .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
hey , that ' s my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated , eight-fold , fourteen-gauge box .
this squishee is awful !
not if i can help it .
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
but i want to see it !
pay the man , homer .
hey , wake up ! we ' re moving .
gimme a " b " ?
there you go . . thanks for comin ' out . . .
dad , look at me ! look at me !
when i raged against the machine , money poured out .
and we have plenty more on homer simpson .
i guess .
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
sir , yes sir ! luckily , i am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat , sir !
i can have all my birthday parties in it !
dad , you can ' t let him take our dog !
hit the road , ya big load !
the store detective !
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .
fine .
you ' ll rent nothing ! this money is mine . i found it !
hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
yeah , homer .
have your cash or food stamps ready !
dad ?
constable wiggum likes to act tough . but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose ?
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
i can ' t take it anymore ! every time i try to relax , she-- ow , my neck !
wow ! can i see your club ?
well , time to hit the books .
as much as i hate that man right now , you gotta love that suit .
you ' re not welcome .
nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
why would duff beer put out a book ?
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .
don ' t you mean present ?
no , not really .
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
um , hey , dad , i , i think he wants a . . .
i hear there ' s a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
i ' ll just pay the fine .
hey , homer ! check it out !
today we learned how to rip a man ' s heart out and show it to him before he dies .
all right !
dad ! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g !
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .
i hear there ' s a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death .
you mean the wild mood swings ?
so are we going to the lake or what ?
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
see ya in the funny pages .
are you kidding ? i reeked !
yeah !
all right , you ' re not a flabbi ! okay ! i got it !

square as " golden books , " pop .
dad !
gimme a " b " ?
yeah , dad ! you ' re a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .
well , time to move on with our lives .
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
huh ?
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
cool . mr . flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
well , maybe i should .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
square as " golden books , " pop .
lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
hey , dad . this came for you in the mail .
i ' m sorry .
mrs . krabappel , i ' m done failing the test . can i please go to the nurse ?
i don ' t know , dad . what if she ' s still mad at me ?
i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
it ' s eight in the morning !
all right , the personals ! hmm . hm-hm-hm . " successful mayor-type seeks open-minded , discreet cheerleader-type . "
i ' d like to play me latest chart-topper . it ' s called " me fans are stupid pigs . "
maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
it ' s the first day of school .
no time .
dad , that ' s a sports bra .
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
nooooo !
put him down , boy ! put him down !
sting !
yes , sir .
are you nuts ?
dad , it ' s may 00th .
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .
good afternoon .
uh oh .
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
sure , dad .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
just dump ' em in the fire , dad .
wait . only that ship is going to mars . our ' s is headed for the sun .
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he ' s really awesome !
are you guys fighting over us ?
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
you can ' t come back later because . . .
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
not if i can help it .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
we are home .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
homer , you ate their jerky .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
i understand why . you were wasted .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
yeah !
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
what if someone catches him ?
homer !
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
hey !
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
i was faking it .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
dad , do you have to hang out at my school ? it ' s bad enough i have to be here three days a week !
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
dad ? !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
what if someone catches him ?
thanks , dad .
work that body , homer .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
i understand why . you were wasted .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
slurp my snot .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
well , i wish homer was here .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
we ' ve seen it , dad .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
hey , look , another spaceship !
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
put it in the bank .
no me gusto . que lastima .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
does something smell funny in here ?
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
an elephant ' s butt ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
mine has a cup holder !
we ' re on food stamps ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
hey !
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
cheeky .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
okay , i promise .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
well , sure you do .
all righty !
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
what happened ?
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
well , you told her , dad .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
so , you fought all those robots ?
oh , yeah .
teamwork is overrated .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
nice try , homer .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
milhouse abandoned me .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
oh , man .
right , dad .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
yes sir .
well , there ' s krusty , itchy , scratchy , poochie , america ' s firefighters and then you , dad .
c ' mon , dad ! the team ' s arriving !
and ?
fine .
let ' s go to the sharper image . they ' ve got a tv shaped like a fifties diner !
hey paris , i saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet . . . your face !
well , i ' m flunkin ' math , and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse .
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
but wouldn ' t that make us con artists ?
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
and ?
why are we still grifting ? the car ' s paid for . doesn ' t that balance out the universe ?
hello ?
yeah .
like to see you fit .
you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
we ' ll see .
but dr . hibbert said not to stress her out .
you throw like my sister , man !
thanks , dad . sure you ' re not gonna be bored ?
i ' unno . came outta the closet .
mom . . . dad . i ' d give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together .
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .
are you kidding ? i reeked !
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
this is so humiliating .
oh , check .
thanks , dad . sure you ' re not gonna be bored ?
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
you got it .
uh-huh . bet he used bait , too .
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
get lost .
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
who ' s the black private dick that ' s the sex machine to all the chicks ?
thanks dad .
okay .
dad , don ' t worry , i got you a place .
what did i do ?
well , time to hit the books .
oh yeah ? they made you build this statue .
are you kidding ? i reeked !
if you call this living .
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
let ' s get this show on the road , man . we got things to do .
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
his house ?
is that the only reason ?
i can have all my birthday parties in it !
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
good afternoon .
no , i mean teacher .
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself .
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
yay , dad !
ah well , maybe just one more hour .
i ' ll do it this afternoon . . .
i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
no ! you never let me be mike singletary !
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
if edison thought of that chair , how come it ' s not on this chart ?
see ya in the funny pages .
i ' m bart simpson . who the hell are you ?
fine .
oh , i thought i ' d check out the warner brothers network .
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
hey , look what i found !
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
hey , what gives ?
you sure this is a good idea ?
nuh-uh .
cool . mr . flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .
don ' t worry , i don ' t even like using the bathroom after you .
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
you can always find your favorite shows next month .
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
dad , i ' ll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol ' danish .
you mean the wild mood swings ?
dad , whatever you say , you know you will always have my love and respect .
all right !
when i raged against the machine , money poured out .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
yes it does .
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .
well , it all started last week in krabappel ' s class . . .
as much as i hate that man right now , you gotta love that suit .
yeah , you know her .
maybe laura could watch us .
no talking like a grizzled 0000 ' s prospector . . . consarnit !
hey , dad , look what i got ! zzzapp ! ! zzzapp ! zzzapp ! zzzapp !
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
everything .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
you think so ?
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
we ' re all proud of you , dad .
not bloody likely .
so ?
yeah ! let ' s go skiing ! / yeah , dad . let ' s go !
that ' s a hitchhiker , homer .
whooa !
he was driving me crazy so i sent him on an errand .
quick gramma , hide !
all right !
will i ever play baseball again ?
not bloody likely .
here you go , dad . i hope you like it . i ' ve forgotten what it is .
hey lis , there was a big train wreck last night . you wanna see the victims ?
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .
um , i ' ve gotta make a phone call .
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
it hurts when i swallow .
oh , okay .
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .
sting !
what are you planting ?
mrs . krabappel , i ' m done failing the test . can i please go to the nurse ?
dad , before you jump to conclusions . . .
read to lisa ? why don ' t you just ask me to kiss her ?
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?
i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .
whoa careful , dad . blow a gasket and you lose your job .
life is good .
huh ?
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
mom . . . dad . i ' d give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together .
you can ' t come back later because . . .
put him down , boy ! put him down !
and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
spuckler mary , please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance . . .

toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
what about sunday ?
mom , is that true ?
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
i ' ll dig an outhouse .

i ' ve kissed three girls .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?

dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
but she might say no .
you have a drinking problem ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .

i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .

it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
hey !
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .

eh , we could try it .
you got it .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
then what was in the coffin ?
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
oh , okay .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .

dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
we are home .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
fresh out .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .

that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
oh , yeah .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
you mean like we just did ?
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
eh , we could try it .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
i concur .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
homer !

oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
huh ?
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .

dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .

i ' ve kissed three girls .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .

nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
dad , come back ! i can ' t walk home with all this stuff !
okay , okay .
hey dad , have fun with your boyfriend .
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
i ' ll say . i learned the true meaning of columbus day .
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
indeed i did .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .

dad , i promise i ' ll be good .
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
stupid kid . do you really think that ' s the way we should communicate ?
i ' m doing the conan o ' brien show and i wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about .

look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
can i burn evidence in it ?
sir , yes sir ! luckily , i am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat , sir !
okay .
it ' s not just a megaphone , dad . it ' s a rapmaster 0000 .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
i can have all my birthday parties in it !
gotta hide .
nice use of the lingo , homer .

well , dad , here ' s my report card . i think you ' ll be pleasantly surprised .
homer . nyahhh .

what ' s a chachi ?
but i want to see it !

he ' s damn opposed ! damn ! damn ! damn opposed !
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
and he taught me how to do this .
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he ' s really awesome !
da-ad --

lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
come on , dad . didn ' t you ever do anything wild when you were a kid ?
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !

hey , how come lisa gets a pony ?
hey , man , i didn ' t do anything wrong .
oh , check .
ay carumba !
awesome ! how ' s he getting around ?
yeah .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
look at me ! i ' m doin ' something !
amen .
there ' s gotta be a million kids here . we ' ll never find ronaldo .
yes . " are you quick to anger ? "

lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?
it ' s okay dad , i can fill in for nelson .
lisa , lisa ! i think you ' re right about dad . something ' s very , very wrong here .
shut up ! shut up !
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
yes !
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
no .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
she makes me taste beer .
just some report i gotta do for school . hey , you want some pie ?
dad , there ' s more to me than just a catchphrase .
that ' s fair . sorry . i deserve it . ow , that one really hurt !
dad , over here !
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
i ' ll have one drink , one cocktail and one booze , please .
huh ?
dad , it ' s may 00th .
if edison thought of that chair , how come it ' s not on this chart ?
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
why don ' t you take a bath in the river ? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago .
this squishee is awful !
no problem . i bought you a hat .
dad , there ' s a bunch of people in the community outreach center .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
homer !
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
i was faking it .
dad !
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
what the ?
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
i ' m just mad all the time .
perish the thought .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
where are you really going ?
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
mount kilimanjaro ?
i thought it was chocolate milk !
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
what a dump !
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
hullo ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
okay , i promise .
well , yeah , but --
we are home .
what about my birthday party ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
i concur .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
sure , why not ?
it ' s a deal .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
how do you know ?
what about my birthday party ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
you ' re the boss .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
oh , man .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
well , sure you do .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
ay carumba !
where are you going ?
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
hey , everybody . look what we got !
well , i wish homer was here .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
what the ?
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
eh , we could try it .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
i ' m under thirty .
now that ' s a broken man .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
hey !
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
do shut up ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
right .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
okay , i ' m sold .
but i thought you loved edison .
well , no .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
all right !
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
i didn ' t take it .
we ' re on food stamps ?
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
what about sunday ?
but i thought uter took my place .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
we know , dad . we were there .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
i ' m bart .
okay , i promise .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
hey , everybody . look what we got !
teamwork is overrated .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
why don ' t you buy it ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
yeah !
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
um hm .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
all right !
now fly -- to the canary islands !
can i stay with you , dad ?
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
uh-oh . school bus .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
bart simpson , at your service .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
ow ! !
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
we ' re out of waffles .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
okay , i promise .
there you go , ratboy .
can i ask you something , dad ?
well , i wish homer was here .
i ' m bart .
dad !
we know , dad . we were there .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
but i thought uter took my place .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
do shut up ?
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
what if someone catches him ?

that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
dad !
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
company physical coming up , huh ?
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
you mean more popular but not as good ?
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
can i ask you something , dad ?
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
mount kilimanjaro ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
work that body , homer .

except a place to live and free food .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
oh , okay .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .

they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
look , that ' s our ship !
what happened ?
perish the thought .
yeah !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
we know , dad . we were there .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
okay , i promise .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
who are you talking to , homer ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
aw , come on .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
there you go , ratboy .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .

or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
dad !
put it in the bank .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
all right , folks show ' s over . no more to see , folks . only sick people want to see my folks kiss .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
yuk !
you have a drinking problem ?
again ! again !
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
again ! again !
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
not so tough now , huh ?
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
now that ' s a broken man .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
yeah , but at least it was short .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
but she might say no .
homer !
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
well , sure you do .
work that body , homer .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
tell it , daddy !
what about my birthday party ?
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
dad ? !
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
mom . get him away from the window .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
what ?
aw thanks , dad .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
perish the thought .
oh , okay .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
where are you going ?
put it in the bank .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
next .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
well . . .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
then what was in the coffin ?
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
who are you talking to , homer ?
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
okay .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
you got it .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
why ?
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
more like the " expandables " !
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
so what if i am ?
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
what are you talking about ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
what about my birthday party ?
more like balder and wider .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?

are you still talking about the earth ?
ow ! you stepped on my arm !
no , look ! it ' s a ride that just opened and no one ' s there !
it doesn ' t sound very tractor-y .
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
sounds like something you ' d say .
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
sir , yes sir ! luckily , i am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat , sir !
good for you . no more drinkin ' ?
thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?

reading prayers and ignoring them , just like god .

hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .

when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
why didn ' t you wait for me ?
wow , dad . you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl ?
a zephyr ?
these games are so old . who got these high scores ? pilgrims ? hmm , never saw this one before .

her pillow ' s stuck .

lookin ' for a spot of fun with the missus , eh guv ' nor ?

her pillow ' s stuck .

well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
wait a minute . they ' re not so great .
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
nooooo !
beer ! beer is the cheese . but how to use it . . .
why did you make it do that ?
you ' re not welcome .
not to mention hilarious .
hey , dad .
yes sir !
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
does anyone here like food ?
if you call this living .
that ' s fair . sorry . i deserve it . ow , that one really hurt !

i don ' t wanna do that .
there ' s the rich texan -- and his daughter , paris texan .
whoa ! yeah , strike three ! you ' re outta there .
our teacher .
well his parents aren ' t married , are they ? it ' s the correct word , isn ' t it ?
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
so , i suppose that ' s a hillbilly jacuzzi ?
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
you don ' t even want to know if i have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late ?
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?
hell no .
all i see is a pole . maybe the flag fell off .
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
dad , you gotta come . i just got your hat out of the fridge .
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
she said " yes . "
homer . nyahhh .
oh .
i ' ll say . i learned the true meaning of columbus day .
. . . but let ' s see what you know about super-heroes .
not bloody likely .
come on , dad , pick up the pace . chew and swallow , no savoring .
huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
is uncle fester still alive ?
nuh-uh .
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
hey , mom , can we go see dad put out the fire ?
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
he did ?
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
dad , over here !
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
oh , yeah .
wait a minute . they ' re not so great .
i am playing in the tournament .
since when ?
looks like you lost the patient , doc .
hey , homer , i found your weights .
good evening , adults .

thanks , but i ' m almost done . why don ' t you get back on the couch and watch tv ?
deal .
give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .
so , i suppose that ' s a hillbilly jacuzzi ?
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger .
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
there you go . . thanks for comin ' out . . .
then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
but they stole our lemon tree !
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?
i got my tenure right here .

are you nuts ?
well , your father was a loser . and his father . and his father . it ' s genetic , man .

when i get through with that flag , it ' s gonna be a bart mangled banner .
we said " meh . "
just dump ' em in the fire , dad .
just dump ' em in the fire , dad .
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .

why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
interesting . when was the term " shut up " invented ?

because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
you could be my father figure .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
where are you really going ?
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .

look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .

hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .

ay carumba !
bart simpson , at your service .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .

hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
oh , man .

look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
teamwork is overrated .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
next .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
mom .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .

skinner didn ' t let me go .
well , you told her , dad .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
you have a drinking problem ?
mine has a cup holder !
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
so what if i am ?
he said what now ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
yes , sir !
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
hey , check it out !
wow , i never thought of it like that .
cool !
an elephant ' s butt ?
therapy , please .
okay , i ' m sold .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
homer .

you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
so prepare yourself , for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan ' s , " paint your wagon ! "
dad , over here !
all night . you were yelling at the swing .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
amen .

is uncle fester still alive ?
dad , i want to be a daredevil .
how do you know ?

how do you know ?
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !

you c ' mere a minute .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
dad !
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
dad , the plan !
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
now !
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
work that body , homer .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
i ' m bart .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
what if someone catches him ?
i already do that .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
i could take up smoking .
therapy , please .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
more like the " expandables " !
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
hurry , homer !
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
mine has a cup holder !
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
what do you think ?
what are you talking about ?
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .

i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
perish the thought .
does something smell funny in here ?
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
well , time to face my punishment like a man . . . or , lie my way out of it like a kid .
bart simpson , at your service .
you can ' t make us come down .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
amen , brother .
that movie ' s for babies .
i suppose .
dad , the plan !
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
why ?
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
there ' s no denying it , sis .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
agreed .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
i ' m under thirty .
tv sucks .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .

here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
i ' m under thirty .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
i need this candy for school .
well , i wish homer was here .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
well , yeah , but --
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
what are you talking about ?
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
look , that ' s our ship !
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .

hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
i can help you .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .

dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
what about abraham lincoln ?
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
but dad . . .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
homer , you ate their jerky .
well , yeah , but --
i was faking it .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
you have a drinking problem ?
oh , man .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
fat guy number three ?
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
now fly -- to the canary islands !
hurry , homer !
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
mom .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
tv sucks .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
mom , is that true ?
teamwork is overrated .
can i stay with you , dad ?
definitely . well , crazy about carjacking .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
agreed .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
wow ! a big ugly head !
testify !
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
dad ? !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
does something smell funny in here ?
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
next .
and how .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
why don ' t you buy it ?
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
agreed .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
what an odd thing to say .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
hey , look , another spaceship !
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
dad !
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
more like balder and wider .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
hey santa , what ' s shaking ?
. . . dad .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
nice try , homer .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
do you want me to watch and learn ?
you mean more popular but not as good ?
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
company physical coming up , huh ?
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
yeah , their guns are right there !
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
thanks , dad .
can i stay with you , dad ?
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
except a place to live and free food .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
mine has a cup holder !
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
eh . this song ' s a little bossy for me .
yee-hawww !
dad , only one of them is real .
uh-huh .
then i ' ll have been on every continent .
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
gay out ?
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
trick-or-treat ! lick my feet ! your head smells like pig-butt meat !
praise the lord .
don ' t be a sap , dad . these are just crappy knock-offs .
what did i do ?
hey dad , why don ' t we watch you drink from a hose ?
my ex-girlfriends .
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .
you ' re the man , homer .
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
mom , please tell me i can go to hell .
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
sounds scrump-didly-umptious , dear old daddly-doodly .
i didn ' t do anything .
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
well . . . maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again .
oh man , now she ' s writing cutesy things with the ribbon .

no reason . brother .
huh ?
no reason . brother .
yes , sir !
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
mom , is that true ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
dad , it-it ' s me !
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
the nineties ? never heard of it .
fat guy number three ?
huh ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?

hurry , homer !
you think so ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .

there you go , ratboy .
you can ' t make us come down .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
wait , dad , look !
dad , it-it ' s me !
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
dad !
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
it ' s your birthday ?

dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
uh-oh . school bus .
aw thanks , dad .
no , we need to sail !
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .

milhouse abandoned me .
hey , what smells so good ?
what if she doesn ' t ?
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
skinner didn ' t let me go .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
we ' re on food stamps ?
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
i could take up smoking .

fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
but i thought uter took my place .
where are you going ?
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
mom , is that true ?
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
dad , the plan !

oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
nope , it ' s real -- check out the watermark .

what is this crap ? are you wearing a wire ?
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .

you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
i ' m under thirty .
hey , look , another spaceship !
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
foxy boxing ?
but i thought you loved edison .
because we ' re poor ?
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?

but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
now that ' s a broken man .
more like balder and wider .
teamwork is overrated .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
ow ! !
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
because we ' re poor ?
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
what happened ?
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
yes , sir .
not so tough now , huh ?
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
we ' re out of waffles .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
i suppose .
dad , how drunk are you ?
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
look , that ' s our ship !
i thought it was chocolate milk !
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
homer !
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
hullo ?
okay , i promise .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .

what ' s with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?
you ' re the man , homer .
you never watched an episode of jimmy kimmel in your life !
oh , it shows ! i haven ' t had a strangle that smooth since i was four .
we ' re all proud of you , dad .
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .
now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it .
monsters ! monsters ! monsters !
lis , skinner is using you . like a pawn on his unholy chess set .
you ' re up to something , aren ' t you ?

permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
nuh-uh , ' cause we called it .

i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .

i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
oh , dad , you are the living end .
so in a way , we ' d just be balancing out the universe .
i don ' t want to take drugs .
any thoughts on how we ' re gonna get there ?
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
yes it does .
give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .

i ' m not the only one , homeboy .
i guess .
dad , you ' re eating dr . phil !

beep .
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .
homer ?

cool . mr . flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .
yeah . he invented stuff , too .
okay , cat . now , if this works , your next trip will be to the bank vault .

i like the beat -- play me the tune .
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
she said " yes . "
dad , don ' t be a credit hog

i can handle that . i ' m an expert at phony apologies .
maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
i ' m sorry , dad . . . you ' re fired !
but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
gross ! weird ! complicated ! go to sleep !
dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--

i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
for what ?
thanks , dad . but part of this d minus belongs to god .

give it up , homer . it ' s locked up tight .
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
i ' ll have one drink , one cocktail and one booze , please .
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
i ' m gonna put my trophy on the mantle . how ' bout you ?

all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
yeah , but i could get seriously hurt .
ow ! you stepped on my arm !
yes sir !
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
he ' s saying goodbye to his wife .
what are you planting ?
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .
what ' s wrong ?
i guess .
no problem . i bought you a hat .
huh ? why didn ' t mom make our lunch ?
incontinent . . . too rich .
have your cash or food stamps ready !
uh . . . toys ?
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !

dad . . . i need help . . . please . . .
dealing drugs ?
uh , dad , i don ' t think the dog can handle any more bacon .
oh , right . what ' d you get her , dad ?
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?
forget about it , homer . you made it to the top . you ' re the coolest dad ever .
isn ' t this supposed to be my project ?
what ' s wrong ?
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .
oh , so many wasted nights . . .
sounds scrump-didly-umptious , dear old daddly-doodly .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
building a soap box derby racer .
you had your hot dog plumped ?
no i didn ' t , dad .
hey dad , can we play ?
no .
read to lisa ? why don ' t you just ask me to kiss her ?
i thought it was chocolate milk !
can i ask you something , dad ?
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
what ? no !
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
hey !
how do you know ?
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
yeah , but at least it was short .

but she might say no .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
yes , sir .
dad , the plan !
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
cheeky .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .
well , i wish homer was here .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
perish the thought .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
there ' s no denying it , sis .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
what if someone catches him ?
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
amen .
oh , it will not .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
can i ask you something , dad ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
wait , dad , look !
and how .
oh , man .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
all right !
testify !
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
why don ' t you buy it ?
what if someone catches him ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
why don ' t you buy it ?
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
busted !
fat guy number three ?
gotcha . well , gotta go .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
hit the road , " welcome home . "
more like the " expandables " !
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
that movie ' s for babies .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
yeah .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
teamwork is overrated .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
hey , what smells so good ?
busted !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
i ' ve kissed three girls .
what about adultery ?
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
nice try , homer .
then what was in the coffin ?
okay , i ' m sold .
i concur .
i ' m under thirty .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
what a dump !
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
what are you talking about ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
but i thought you loved edison .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
cool !
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
i thought it was chocolate milk !
so what if i am ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
but i thought uter took my place .
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
aw , dad .
we know , dad . we were there .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
hey , that ' s my badge , homer .
you could be my father figure .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
i concur .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
eh , we could try it .
what do you think ?
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
christmas .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
can i ask you something , dad ?
yeah , their guns are right there !
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
what about abraham lincoln ?
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
mom , is that true ?
what an odd thing to say .
krusty !
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
yes , sir !
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
okay , let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah , legitimately , but you ' re too scared to do anything fun with it ?
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
i ' m gonna pose as an italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money .
hey , what smells so good ?
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
what ? no !
slurp my snot .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
the fat guy on tv ?
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
hey , look , another spaceship !
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
uh-oh . school bus .
you mean like we just did ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
we ' re on food stamps ?
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
except a place to live and free food .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
that movie ' s for babies .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
how do you know ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
huh ?
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
mount kilimanjaro ?
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
um hm .
i ' ll dig an outhouse .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
why don ' t you buy it ?
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .

tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
dad , you blew it . you listened to lisa . and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience .
think about it . i mean , what " team " was babe ruth on ? who knows ?
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
lisa , lisa ! i think you ' re right about dad . something ' s very , very wrong here .
will i ever play baseball again ?
c ' mon , dad ! the team ' s arriving !
no belching .
no , not really .
but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
oh , okay .
yes it does .
do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass ?
uh , dad ?
hey , man , i didn ' t do anything wrong .

well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?

uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
okay , okay .
it ' s eight in the morning !
nelson took my lunch money again !

i can ' t wait to get the freshness out of my mouth !
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?

oh , oh . hey , cool , man .
dad , don ' t worry , i got you a place .
mom , do you have any idea how i got this scar ?

but dad , my heart hurts .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
no ! you never let me be mike singletary !
why would god punish a kid ? i mean , an american kid ?
my ex-girlfriends .
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .
no time .

hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
i got suspended from school today .

no belching .
is that the only reason ?
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
can i burn evidence in it ?

dad ' s been doing that for two hours !
i think lisa ' s right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .

tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
i love you , dad .

so prepare yourself , for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan ' s , " paint your wagon ! "

dr . hibbert found out my thyroid isn ' t pumping out enough--

well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
don ' t give up , dad .
did you check your pocket ?
hello , mr . stanky . . . i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha . . . who am i ? let ' s just say i ' m a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .

right , dad .
okay .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
hit the road , " welcome home . "
but she might say no .
i guess it ' s possible .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .

if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .

hey , homer , i found your weights .
thanks , dad .
my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?

praise the lord .

milhouse abandoned me .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .

i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !

you mean more popular but not as good ?
mine has a cup holder !
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
where did the ship stop again ?

um hm .
wait , dad , look !
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
amen .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
yes , sir .

way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
well , you told her , dad .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .

okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
did you check your pocket ?

but i thought uter took my place .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
yes , sir .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
now that ' s a broken man .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .

hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
homer , you ate their jerky .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
bart simpson , at your service .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
so what if i am ?
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .

it ' s gone .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .

i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
why ?
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
you have a drinking problem ?
amen .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
who ' s in there ?

but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
cool man !
milhouse abandoned me .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
oh , man .
work that body , homer .
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
what if someone catches him ?
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
krusty !

i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
so , you fought all those robots ?
yes , sir .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
cheeky .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
i ' ll supervise .
foxy boxing ?
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
aw , dad .
where are you really going ?
can i have a beer ?
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
eh , we could try it .
yes , sir !
krusty !
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
nice try , homer .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
an elephant ' s butt ?
who are you talking to , homer ?
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
okay , i ' m sold .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .

well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
dad ? ! you always hated church !
we ' re on food stamps ?
ay carumba !
what about abraham lincoln ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
oh , man .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .

that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
what an odd thing to say .
what if she doesn ' t ?
i guess it ' s possible .
but she might say no .
aye carumba !
that imposter !
what ' d you do with all the loot ?
thanks , dad .
i don ' t think you even like santa ' s little helper !
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
no . i won ' t .
if you really wanted us to be neater , you ' d serve us out of one long bowl .
come on , dad . they ' re all scrawny little bags of bones .
trick-or-treat ! lick my feet ! your head smells like pig-butt meat !
i can ' t take it anymore ! every time i try to relax , she-- ow , my neck !

you know , for a while , i was kinda looking forward to bein ' a dad .
sorry dad , but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad ' s help .
hey , homer . this house sucks .
you mean the wild mood swings ?
monsters ! monsters ! monsters !
but wouldn ' t that make us con artists ?
dad , only one of them is real .

oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
maybe .
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
/ get your hands off of me , you fat ass--
not if i can help it .
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
dad , you can ' t let him take our dog !
well , just this week , there ' s been field day , picking me up from the airport . . .
it ' s not just a megaphone , dad . it ' s a rapmaster 0000 .
yes !
wow , you can do anything out here .
yes !
oh man , now she ' s writing cutesy things with the ribbon .
they have it now .

i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?

the secret ingredient is blood .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
and he said if we went to the cops , he ' d come back for maggie .
pound him , dad !
ow .
i don ' t want to take drugs .
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !
nooooo !
starting today , we ' re carnies . just like you .
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .
oh no . you ' re in texas !
oh no , not another boring space launch ! change the channel ! change the channel !
what about the people on the bottom ?
squealer .
homer ?
her pillow ' s stuck .
that was too close . maybe it ' s time to quit the game .
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
hm , if i save you , what are you gonna do to me ?
we never had a family meeting before .
what is this crap ? are you wearing a wire ?
today we learned how to rip a man ' s heart out and show it to him before he dies .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
yeah .
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .

i ' ve got a partner .
gimme a " b " ?
oh , i don ' t get a song ? mom got a song .

what about the people on the bottom ?

so what ' s our first job , huh ? test the roller coaster ?
wow , dad . you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl ?
mom . . . dad . i ' d give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together .
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .

this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
well , you told her , dad .
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
oh , okay .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .

if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
no , we need to sail !
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !

who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
bart simpson , at your service .

dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
we are home .

this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
this is so humiliating .
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
well , according to red ' s schedule , we have to make it to atlanta in three days .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .

wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?

lisa , lisa ! i think you ' re right about dad . something ' s very , very wrong here .
yeah , you know her .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !

we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !
what ? why ?
i ' d like to play me latest chart-topper . it ' s called " me fans are stupid pigs . "
don ' t worry , homeboy , you ' re not that fast .
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
what ' s up ? going crazy again ?
not if i can help it .
nelson took my lunch money again !

but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
i ' unno . came outta the closet .
why should i ? it ' s just gonna get dirty again .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
hey , what gives ?
squawky ?
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
wow , you can do anything out here .
i will , dad .
so much for the days when i could say " at least my mother ' s normal . "
i did .
no ! you never let me be mike singletary !
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
aren ' t those full of germs ?
okay , i ' ll try .
you ' re not welcome .
ooh ! ahh ! ooh ! ahh ! ahh ! ahh ! ohh !
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
all the beer from the landfill is gone , beer baron . we ' re out of business .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
i need this candy for school .
fat guy number three ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
not so tough now , huh ?
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
um hm .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
well , sure you do .
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
do you know who else was really into rowboats ? jesus . and he could ' ve turned his rowboat into a jet ski , but he didn ' t . good guy .
what happened ?
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
i want to watch krusty .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .

no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
can i have a beer ?
homer !
i ' ve kissed three girls .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
foxy boxing ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
i want to watch krusty .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
milhouse abandoned me .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?

dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
but i thought you loved edison .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
look , that ' s our ship !

fat guy number three ?
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .

luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .

i understand why . you were wasted .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
do shut up ?
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !

hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
the fat guy on tv ?
well , i wish homer was here .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
no me gusto . que lastima .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "

yes , sir !
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
you got it .
hey , i love watching you guys fight . it ' s my earliest memory .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .

well , yeah , but --
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
look , that ' s our ship !
but i don ' t hate this country .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
can i ?
more like the " expandables " !
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
did you check your pocket ?
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
perish the thought .
i didn ' t take it .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
agreed .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
oh , man .
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
dad , the plan !
i was faking it .

mom . get him away from the window .
okay .
you c ' mere a minute .
what do you think ?
amen .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
dad , the plan !
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
bart simpson , at your service .
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
amen .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
and how .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
well , no .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
the fat guy on tv ?
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
i didn ' t take it .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i ' m bart .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
what a dump !
dad , the mailman is here .
yeah , but at least it was short .
i ' m under thirty .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .

dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
all right !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
you c ' mere a minute .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
perish the thought .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
right .
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
then what was in the coffin ?
what about sunday ?
more like balder and wider .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
why ?
but i don ' t hate this country .
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !
look , that ' s our ship !
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !

i ' m bart .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
you think so ?
i ' m under thirty .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
it ' s a deal .
what about sunday ?
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
ay carumba !
hey , what smells so good ?
nice try , homer .
busted !
the fat guy on tv ?
glad you didn ' t come cheap .
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .

how ' bout the disney minority program ?
but , dad , you ' ll never make it .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !

hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
dad , it just kinda happened . you ' re taking this too hard .
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
yes , sir !
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
what if someone catches him ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
you could be my father figure .
who are you talking to , homer ?
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
well , i wish homer was here .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
agreed .
busted !
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
dad !
dad ? !
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
oh , okay .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
gotcha . well , gotta go .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
what ' s that ? a home-made bat ?
stupid kid . do you really think that ' s the way we should communicate ?
well , it ' s your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell !
cool . mr . flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .
well , actually . . . i may have accidentally traded a few of those pills , for money . . .
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
hey mom , can i have some money to buy dad a present ?
i ' m trying , dad .
okay , okay .
balloon ride , wax museum , the denzel washington monument , colonial phoenix , hey , dude ranch !
only the coolest kid ever could think of that ! good golly , sven-golly ! you did it !
ah , dad , if just me , milhouse and lewis had voted . . .
don ' t be a sap , dad . these are just crappy knock-offs .
and don ' t worry , all the laundry and dirty dishes ' ll be there when you get back .
dad , the car !
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
oh , no .
wowww ! !
yeah , dad ! you ' re a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .
sounds like something you ' d say .
and ?
in the cart .
ah well , maybe just one more hour .
not bloody likely .
well if you love it so much , why are you always littering ?
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .
looks like you lost the patient , doc .
hey , homer , you promised mom you wouldn ' t wear your dress outside .
thanks , dad .
indeed i did .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
uh , nothin ' , pop .
aw , man ! we just missed it .
gay out ?
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
hello ?
hey dad , you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight .
but you ' ve gotta support the team , dad . they ' re already threatening to move to moose jaw .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
yep .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
he hit us !
pound him , dad !
i hear there ' s a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death .
yeah .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
actually , we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours .
hear that , boy ? you ' re gonna be a racing pigeon !
oh , yeah .
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
squealer .
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
they ' ll buy anything !
hey , look what i found !
well . . . maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again .
oh , go for it , dad .
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
dear lisa . psych . psych , psych , psych . signed , super-psych .
he certainly has , dad . i learned a real lesson here today . thank you . dr . hibbert .
i promise .
oh , right . what ' d you get her , dad ?
all right , homer . it ' s your moment . but he ' s mine tomorrow .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
homer , you ' re . . . um . . . on the towel rack .
we don ' t need dental floss either , mom .
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .
hey , dad , something didn ' t get , um , " sorted " .
okay , gaiman , you ' re in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
it ' s okay , dad . he ' s just putting the fear of god in me .
our teacher .
mom , do you have any idea how i got this scar ?
seriously dad , i ' m worried . you should go on a diet .
please , fbi man , don ' t throw us in jail . we just made one mistake .
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
our teacher .
why didn ' t you wait for me ?
good evening , adults .
homer !
you mean the wild mood swings ?
dad ! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g !
permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
yeah .
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
he looks happy .
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !
gay out ?
just dump ' em in the fire , dad .
well , something chewed through the cellar door . . . and the floor is covered with paw prints . . .
nelson took my lunch money again !
don ' t be a sap , dad . these are just crappy knock-offs .
don ' t worry , dad , it ' s just a commercial . no one will remember this in fifty years .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
this is all my fault , dad . i didn ' t want you to get hurt .
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
see ya in the funny pages .
. . . but let ' s see what you know about super-heroes .
they ' re all about smugglers .
sting !
can ' t live this way . . . anymore .
gimme ! i want more !
policeman .
so in a way , we ' d just be balancing out the universe .
simp-son ! ! ! where ' s my dinner ? !
forget about it , homer . you made it to the top . you ' re the coolest dad ever .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la !
oh !
ready . set . hut , hut !
please dad .
oh , go for it , dad .
aren ' t those full of germs ?
if edison thought of that chair , how come it ' s not on this chart ?
they ' d work much better without the padding , doc .
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .
maybe laura could watch us .
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
maybe .
aren ' t we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?
what ' s your system ?
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
what a dump !
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
dad , can i ask you a question ? how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
mount kilimanjaro ?
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
huh ?
what about my birthday party ?
oops , my homework !
i ' ll supervise .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
oops , my homework !
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
the fat guy on tv ?
dad , you barely go to work at all .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
therapy , please .
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
you c ' mere a minute .
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
who are you talking to , homer ?
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
why don ' t you buy it ?
christmas .
well . . .
again ! again !
right , dad .
what if she doesn ' t ?
what ? no !
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
we ' ll be dead . . . shot through the head
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
oh yeah ? if you don ' t keep splashing the cash , i ' m gonna tell mom that it ' s thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever .
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
but i thought you loved edison .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
i didn ' t take it .
why ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
cool !
amen .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
cheeky .
really , dad ?
what about my birthday party ?
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .
now !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
but you ' re not gonna get divorced like milhouse ' s parents , are you ?
well , yeah , but --
perish the thought .
i guess it ' s possible .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
well , if you ' re lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
how do you know ?
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
what if someone catches him ?
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
our book ! the real one !
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
you have a drinking problem ?
does something smell funny in here ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
but i thought uter took my place .
but she might say no .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
fresh out .
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .

wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .

i thought it was chocolate milk !
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
homer , you ate their jerky .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .

check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
it ' s your birthday ?
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .

no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
well , at least ned is trying ! what are you doing to help ?
i ' ve kissed three girls .

hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
amen .
oops , my homework !
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "

final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
what ? no !
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
amen .
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
dad ? ! you always hated church !
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
your electric hammer , maestro ?
luxury ? this thermostat is just painted on .
oh , it will not .
because we ' re poor ?
why ?
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
what if someone catches him ?
what ?
well , yeah , but --
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
wait ! he ' s just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
you ' ll really help me get revenge ?
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
aw , dad .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
our book ! the real one !
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
hey , check it out !
does something smell funny in here ?
i didn ' t take it .
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
amen , brother .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
hey !
don ' t worry , boy . i ' ll love you even if you don ' t win .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
dad ? !
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
dad ! these people are my friends ! don ' t fear them just because they have a different religion , a different culture , and their last name is bin laden !
anything slim !
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
next .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
well . . . there ' s a tall boy in front of me in class so i can ' t see the board .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
what happened ?
why ?
mine has a cup holder !
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
no , it was the night you got loaded at moe ' s and the car had to be towed home .
put it in the bank .
why the hell would i want to see that ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .

c ' mon , dad . i ' ve seen you hit the toilet from here .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !

uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
then what was in the coffin ?
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .

foxy boxing ?
i ' m under thirty .

dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
ow ! !
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .

lisa got a sister ! why can ' t you have another boy ?
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
are you nuts ? you can ' t even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
paw !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
hurry , homer !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
what about abraham lincoln ?
what about sunday ?
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
but i don ' t hate this country .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
a real swiss army knife . cool !
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
hello , mr . . . kurns ? i bad want . . . money now . me sick .
aw , come on .
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i ' m good at .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
fresh out .
i already do that .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
i ' m under thirty .
sure you were , rummy .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
come one , come all , top hat theatre is on the air . the most beautiful women in the world . just fifty-cents . i am your host , bart simpson . you must be at least eight years old to enter .
well . . .
you c ' mere a minute .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
there ' s gotta be some batteries in here somewhere .
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
i was faking it .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
wow ! a big ugly head !
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
all right !
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
she ' ll see through me like grandma ' s underpants .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
dad !
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
dad !
yeah !
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
should i get my helmet ?
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
have your cash or food stamps ready !
whoa ! " guts of war two : entrails of intestinox ! "
excellent .
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
gay out ?
waaaaaaaah !
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
good afternoon .

but dad , you ' ve gotta tell her . she ' s been buying brand-name groceries .
so are we going to the lake or what ?
then i ' ll have been on every continent .

do you get hbo ?
what ' s his problem ?

then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
yeah ! let ' s go skiing ! / yeah , dad . let ' s go !
uh-huh .
dad , you cannot wear that ! that ' s a rastafarian hat !
i have a question .
she said " yes . "
gee , sorry for being born .
not to mention hilarious .
have you been " oh boy " -ing all night ?
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .
why do we have to audition for this stupid play and dad gets to leave ?
dad . . . i couldn ' t stay with mom and lisa while you were out here .
homer , whatever they ' ve got you on , cut the dose .
he did ?
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
we tricked you ! / eat nerf , homeboy !
uh , dad ?
dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
monsters ! monsters ! monsters !

i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
hitler mash-ups .
and there ' s one itchy and scratchy cartoon i don ' t think we ' ll ever forget .

dear lisa . psych . psych , psych , psych . signed , super-psych .
hell , yes .
my ex-girlfriends .
oh , dad , you are the living end .
are you kidding ? he ' s my idol . i ' ve based my whole life on krusty ' s teachings .
are you still talking about the earth ?
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
she makes me taste beer .
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .
dad , i ' m asking if i can get a job .
i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .
yeah , but at least we ' ll take a lot of innocent people with us .
no , i mean teacher .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
and ?
building a soap box derby racer .
i love you , dad .
that ' s a hitchhiker , homer .
whoa , it ' s santa , all right ! and he is kickin ' ass !
maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
ladies and gentlemen : fallout boy !
if you really wanted us to be neater , you ' d serve us out of one long bowl .
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
thanks , dad .
good evening , adults .

hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .
oh , this sucks . i want to see vice-president cletus .
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
oh !
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court .
hey dad , can we play ?
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
oh yeah , safety sells . especially to lame-o ' s .
c ' mon , man . a few more balloons and this ' ll look really awesome .
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out . does that help ?
aye carumba !
you ' re the man , homer .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .

spuckler mary , please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance . . .

i love you too , dad .
dad , stop !

lisa and i want to finance a series of animated cartoons .

a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .

who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
you can ' t make us come down .
why ?
yes , sir .
oops , my homework !
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
ay carumba !
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
alec baldwin , wow . that is the coolest person you ' ve ever been fired by . what was it like at their house ?
it ' s your birthday ?
can i ask you something , dad ?
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
dad , the plan !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
except a place to live and free food .
huh ?
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
ay carumba !
you can ' t make us come down .
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
okay .
sorry , no can do . i ' m taking off for six months to join the skewed tour .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
teamwork is overrated .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
. . . dad .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
there you go , ratboy .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
amen , brother .
teamwork is overrated .
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
this one ' s against us . this one ' s for us . for , for , against , for , against . . .
c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
hey , everybody . look what we got !
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
did you check your pocket ?
okay .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
he said what now ?
we are home .

you ' ll really help me get revenge ?

dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
what about adultery ?
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
what about abraham lincoln ?
i was faking it .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?

always thinking two moves ahead .
hey , the burglar left his calling card .
way to go , buck . i feel my faith growing anew .

i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
why are you taping flanders , dad ?

no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
aw thanks , dad .
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
yeah ! listen , homer . . . do you ever think about what you want to do when you ' re grown up ?
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
gotcha . well , gotta go .
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
why ?
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
we ' ve seen it , dad .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
amen .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
because we ' re poor ?
people of earth , this is bartron , commander of the martian invasion force . your planet is in our hands . resistance is useless .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?

i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
we know , dad . we were there .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
gotcha . well , gotta go .
because we ' re poor ?
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
i already do that .
dad , how drunk are you ?
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
i am so sick of hearing about lisa . just because she ' s doing a little better than me . . .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
oh , okay .

i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
he ' s a diving horse . maybe he could dive for pearls .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
nice try , homer .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?

but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .

thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
homer !
oh , man .

no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
uh , well , since we ' re here , i ' m gonna go try to get al roker ' s autograph .
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
how do you know ?
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .

maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .
hey , homer , i found your weights .

my story takes place in a time i call " the past " .
dad , you ' re a hero !

i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
okay .

thanks dad .
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
if you love me so much , why don ' t you marry me ? that ' s a good one .
this way to the scene of the crime , men . i ' ve got her tied up in the den .
like to see you fit .
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
not to mention hilarious .
she just found out no one likes her . i thought she knew !
hey , there ' s a bug that looks like dad . let ' s kill it .
is uncle fester still alive ?
lisa ! dad ! c ' mere quick ! there is something that you won ' t believe !

you ' ll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .
i got my tenure right here .

the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
i don ' t know what that stuff blocks .
excellent .
we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster .
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .

i ' unno . came outta the closet .
isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
now !
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .

look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
oops , my homework !
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
cheeky .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
dad !
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?
all righty !
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
hey , that ' s my washcloth .
ow ! !

yeah .
okay , i promise .
check out lisa . she ' s a sax machine ! makes me think i should ' ve done something with my life . oh , well .
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
well , you told her , dad .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
we ' re out of waffles .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i thought it was over . you had a problem turning a blade , you overcame it . the feel-good story of the year .
it ' s pretty scary out here , dad . dad ?
can i ask you something , dad ?
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !

rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
hurry , homer !
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
but it ' s not my fault you ' re leaving , it ' s yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
why the hell would i want to see that ?
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .

are you sure that thing could really explode ?
i guess it ' s possible .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .

dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?

what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
hey , would you ever wanna have a real job and a family ?
teamwork is overrated .
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
sure you were , rummy .
do you think i ' m dumb enough to fall for that . i ' m insulted .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .

there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
mom , is that true ?
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
dad , you could punish me . but that means you ' d have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it . . .

zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
teamwork is overrated .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .

well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
kwyjibo : uh , a big , dumb , balding . . .

i ' m under thirty .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
hey , i call first bedsies !
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .

i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
i know ! we ' ll be in another movie -- and this time we ' ll act really bad !
there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !
hey , dad . . . sell you these for fifty bucks .
yeah . he invented stuff , too .
why would duff beer put out a book ?
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?
but she might say no .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
are you sure that thing could really explode ?
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they ' ll print the wrong book -- our book .

yeah , folks , the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks .
therapy , please .
dad , if you take me to vegas , i ' ll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .

no , i ' m not . i suck .
mom .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
mine has a cup holder !
dad , how drunk are you ?

dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .

work that body , homer .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
okay .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
so , are you a colonel or a captain ?
amen .
teamwork is overrated .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
hey , that ' s my washcloth .

well , that ' s great , dad , except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper .
dad , you gotta come . i just got your hat out of the fridge .
please dad .
well , maybe i should .
yes . " are you quick to anger ? "
isn ' t this supposed to be my project ?
all right , you ' re not a flabbi ! okay ! i got it !
are you still talking about the earth ?
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
it ' s like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen .
excellent .
i don ' t wanna do that .
throw hot wax on him , dad !
hey , i think it ' s cool . i can defibrillate lisa !

aren ' t we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
yeah , dad ! you ' re a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .
i am going easy on you , but you ' re just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .
i thought i ' d investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs .
i ' d say that the pressure ' s finally gotten to dad , but what pressure ?
to pay for a lawyer for my bum .
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .
shaddap !
you are .
they ' d work much better without the padding , doc .
even that praying mantis is losin ' it .
i never heard of this new hospital so i looked it up and printed it out .
well , all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn .
wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
dad , i ' ll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol ' danish .
why didn ' t you wait for me ?

yeah , mom says a lot of things .
hitler mash-ups .
uh-oh , kwyjibo on the loose !
hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
if you call this living .

this is for love , dad . someday you ' ll feel what i feel .
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
it ' s all right , lisa . don ' t go . more heaven for me .
are you gonna eat that all by yourself ?
and he said if we went to the cops , he ' d come back for maggie .
we know you ' re innocent , dad .
she makes me taste beer .
hey , the heart wants what it wants , dude .
go ! go ! go ! now ' s your chance !
i wasn ' t drinking . i was learning that nature isn ' t a complete waste of space .
dad , you ate all the free samples . now you ' re eating men ' s slacks .
so i won ' t get to go to camp ?
when you ' re gettin ' juiced , can you hold my turtle ? i wanna bring him back to life .
i love you , dad .
nooooo !
oh , yeah .
no belching .
we were good , dad . they asked us to play in the krusty klassic !
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
whoa ! they like each other !
wowww ! !
no .
i ' m sorry .
oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
hey , dad . what do you say we toss the ol ' apple around , huh ? sound like fun ?
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
squealer .
what are you doing ?
dad , the mailman is here .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
go for it .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
no reason . brother .
that movie ' s for babies .
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i ' ll tell you the truth , dad . i wasn ' t good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you ' re not mad .
i ' ll supervise .
hey , i call first bedsies !
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
i could take up smoking .
don ' t give up , dad .
milhouse abandoned me .
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
go for it .
right , dad .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
who are you talking to , homer ?
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
a real swiss army knife . cool !
you spent all the money i earned ? !
you have a drinking problem ?
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
buck gave it to me . he ' s just about the greatest guy who ever lived . i wanna grow up to be just like him .
you c ' mere a minute .
mine has a cup holder !
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
well , no .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
agreed .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
well , i guess it ' s tinkle time .
hey , what smells so good ?
what ' s wrong with the one i got ?
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
dad , it-it ' s me !
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
pfft . you ' ll never out-sit me .
a man innocently changes his oil , when . . . a two-ton car comes crashing down !
foxy boxing ?
i guess it ' s possible .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
dad , the mailman is here .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
so , you fought all those robots ?
amen .
it ' s your birthday ?
we ' ve seen it , dad .
how ' d you like to be played by john goodman ?
cheeky .
i understand why . you were wasted .
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
tons .
sure , why not ?
tell it , daddy !
i understand why . you were wasted .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .
i understand why . you were wasted .
cool man !
yeah .
fresh out .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
choose your corncob ! en garde !
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !
we are home .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
ay carumba !
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
hit the road , " welcome home . "
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
foxy boxing ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
dad , the plan !
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
yes , sir .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
dad , the mailman is here .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
i met this kid . a little older , kind of strange . i don ' t think other people get him , but i just wanna hang out with him all the time .
can i have a beer ?
work that body , homer .
i guess it ' s possible .
i ' ll bring you home my dessert .
what ? no !
hey homer , can we have a can of frosting for lunch ?
sure , why not ?
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
more like the " expandables " !
well , i wish homer was here .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
we found you smoldering in the bushes .
that coop looks a little flimsy .
what are we going to do , hang ourselves ?
sorry , dad .
dad , you don ' t have ten thousand dollars .
oh , i dreamt it was the last day of school .
oh , go eat some flowers .
what ?
didn ' t have to , i ' m a dude .
hey , my-my pants aren ' t down !

playing with milhouse .
yeah ! hell , damn , fart !
hey , homer .
ay carumba !
i need a hundred dollars for a comic book .
responsibly .
she ' s been gone for a while .
or is it ?
come on everybody . it makes you feel better .
hell , yes .
he made it !
haven ' t you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder ?
dad , stop !
oh yeah . / that ' s it .
i don ' t feel them .
heh , heh , heh heh . . .
i ' m starving ! somebody bring me some food , quick !
like i don ' t have a soul ?
even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys ?
no , act like a lion !
mom , i mean it . i wanna ride with you .
why is she saying all this ? is she dying ?
i love you too , dad .
he wouldn ' t sign my ball .
no way , man !
what are you gonna change your name to when you grow up ?
this guy ' s always on !
oh , that ' s disgusting .
keep the trial going . i ' ll be right back .
mom , i mean it . i wanna ride with you .
dad . . . marinating with you is cool .
oh , sorry .
yo , chump , you back again ?
that coop looks a little flimsy .
uh , that ' s a mirror .
whoa -- playdudes !
os-os .
he made it !
aw , he ' s trying to eat ewectwicity .
you won ' t believe how i got home .
race ya !

i said , or is it ?
put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet !
we ' ll bring you back something nice .
dad ! knocking over a gravestone is bad luck !
well , here . say something .
aw , dad . it ' s just a popularity contest .
he ' s right , mom .
hey , i need those cookies for santa .
keep the trial going . i ' ll be right back .
let it go , dad .
oh , that ' s disgusting .
i want to stay here with mr . burns .
nelson .
oh yeah . / that ' s it .
lisa ' s slumber party .
yours .
now how am i supposed to get to soccer practice ?
dad !
oh yeah . / that ' s it .
who the hell is pepi ?
oh yeah .

lisa and i want to finance a series of animated cartoons .
i don ' t have a blue shirt .
that ' s great , dad .

lisa ' s slumber party .

put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet !
kid at school .

oh , forget it .
fill the board then wash my car .

dad , we ' re not in their area code anymore .
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .
what ' s your system ?
ready . set . hut , hut !
man , i wish i was an adult so i could break the rules .
dad , i promise i ' ll be good .

huh -- garbage angels ?
he says , there aren ' t any easy answers ! i say , he ' s not looking hard enough !
no , wait . i have a plan . but i ' ll need your underpants .
what are you doing ?
you bet i do .
they ' re not mine . my boss said his warehouse was full .
come on dad , it ' d be weird .
why are we still grifting ? the car ' s paid for . doesn ' t that balance out the universe ?

hey , homer , i found your weights .

and the lord said , " let there be crap . "

hey , homer , i found your weights .
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
wait , dad . don ' t do it . i won ' t jump anymore , i promise .
aren ' t those full of germs ?
hey , don ' t blame me . i gotta compete with tv , and the internet .
dad , i want to be a daredevil .

c ' mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
okay .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
go for it .
sure , why not ?
uh , homer ? it ' s five years later and i ' m still miserable at school .
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
our book ! the real one !

where are you going ?
we know , dad . we were there .
right .
should i get my helmet ?
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .

hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
yuk !
oops , my homework !
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
do shut up ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
well i ' ve got a valentine ' s day story ! it ' s about musicians from a simpler time . the era of the brady bunch , donny and marie , and . . .
all right !
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?

nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .

i ' ll supervise .

why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
oh , man .

well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
church , cult . cult , church . so we get bored someplace else every sunday . does this really change our day-to-day lives ?

hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
yeah !
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .

final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
more like balder and wider .
fat guy number three ?

oh , okay .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !

before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
well , yeah , but --
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
oh well , he ' s happy . i ' m gonna keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
i ' m bart .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
ay carumba !
well , the next match is saturday . can you come then ?
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
you ' re the boss .
mine has a cup holder !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
aw thanks , dad .
again ! again !
dad , the plan !
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
or like when . . . i got nothin ' . uh , let ' s just find that piece .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
except a place to live and free food .
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?
i ' ll supervise .
well , i picked it up somewhere . and if i drive martin ' s car i can win . i ' m sorry , but . . .
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? aren ' t we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
he said what now ?
i ' m not giving up . i don ' t care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town . i ' m gonna find my dog .
dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
you c ' mere a minute .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
well , no .
oh , yeah .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
milhouse abandoned me .
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
aw thanks , dad .
testify !
your electric hammer , maestro ?
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .

c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
yeah .
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
more like balder and wider .
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
why would i want a nap ?
i didn ' t take it .
why would i want a nap ?
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
aw , dad .
it ' s your birthday ?
well . . .
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
dad , neither of us wanna go . why are you doing this ? where ' s the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .
what ? aren ' t we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers ?
aw thanks , dad .
it ' s a deal .

a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
so long -- i ' m gonna sleep over at ralph ' s .
yeah , but don ' t other people have mail in there ?
how ' bout this ? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile .
wah , wah , wah . ain ' t i cute ? you owe me a dirt bike .
dad , it was an empty building . it was supposed to come down !
paw !

paw !
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
i ' m practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
no , dad , i should really . . . whoop !
dad , the mailman is here .
dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
yeah .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
that ' s great , champ . i know you ' ve been wantin ' that . well , gotta mosey . homer . ma ' am .

hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .

dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .

okay .
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
mount kilimanjaro ?
but dad . . .
oh , it will not .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
teamwork is overrated .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
guys who call themselves " preacher " or " deacon " are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .
okay .
oh , yeah .
eh , we could try it .
okay .
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
if you try to run / you ' ll get a heart attack . . .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
perish the thought .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
oh , no . what if they botch it ? i won ' t have a dad . . . for a while .
why don ' t you just quit taking the pills , you hophead ?
i thought it was chocolate milk !

why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
dad , it-it ' s me !
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
go for it .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
because we ' re poor ?
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
dad , i ' ve done everything i could and i ' ve only got thirty-five bucks . ugh . . i am through with working . working is for chumps .
j -- just the product you need . e -- excellent value . r -- retailer ' s dream . k--

what a dump !
all righty !
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
right , dad .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
i could take up smoking .
yeah , their guns are right there !
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
as long as you ' re doin ' things for me , would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i already do that .
um , i don ' t know how much more school i can miss .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
dad , that ' s bashir -- my new friend .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
it ' s gone .
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
what happened ?
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
here ' s the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he ' ll fire ned on the spot .
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
oh , it will not .
wow , i never thought of it like that .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
wow , this is so much like my dreams it ' s scary .
dad ? ! you always hated church !
let ' s go to the sharper image . they ' ve got a tv shaped like a fifties diner !
but dr . hibbert said not to stress her out .
hey , dad . i ' m gonna make a human yo-yo . if you object , clearly say " no " .
huh -- garbage angels ?
i ' ll say . i learned the true meaning of columbus day .
dad , i promise i ' ll be good .
so what ' s our first job , huh ? test the roller coaster ?
not to mention hilarious .

then we had to do two hours of origami , followed by flower arranging and meditation .
hey , man , you were crushing me . i tried to scream , but my mouth was full of flab .
y ' know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .
squealer .
hello , sir .
well dad , we may not always get along , but we ' ll never be that lame .
uh , here ' s a better sign , dad .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
you can always find your favorite shows next month .
well , pop , what are you gonna do ?
trade you my next turn for your dessert .
but they stole our lemon tree !
no , dad , he ' s my friend !
dad , i feel like i ' m gonna throw up .

i got my tenure right here .
don ' t be a sap , dad . these are just crappy knock-offs .

her pillow ' s stuck .

i didn ' t do anything .
it ' s the coolest video game ever !
dad , have you seen the girls they have in those contests ? hubba , hubba .
ahhhh . welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer bart simpson .
indeed i did .
after dinner , can i watch cartoons ?
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .

i ' m gonna put my trophy on the mantle . how ' bout you ?

hey dad , can we play ?
dude , i think the lady ' s made her decision .
hey boy , come here ! you ' re a good dog ! come on , we don ' t need them to get a thanksgiving dinner !
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
hey ! wait a minute , does this have anything to do with santa ' s little helper ?

i ' ve kissed three girls .

the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .

no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
games don ' t have lives or points anymore , dad .
thanks , pop .
cool man !
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
thanks dad , that means a lot to me .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
why are you taping flanders , dad ?
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
you mean i can go ?
christmas .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !
not what i was hoping for , but it ' ll do .
you mean i can go ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
no , i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth .
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
what do you think ?
who ' s in there ?
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
can i stay with you , dad ?
dad , i know we don ' t do a lot together , but helping you gain 00 pounds is something i want to be a part of .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
who would ' ve thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .
tv sucks .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
put it in the bank .

i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
hey , look , another spaceship !

but i don ' t hate this country .
what happened ?
i could take up smoking .
yes , sir .
i concur .
i wouldn ' t be here if you were more of a role model ! pub crawls , naked frisbee golf . . .
tv sucks .
i didn ' t mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .

they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i ' ll help you , kid .
yeah . i wish maggie had to go to the emergency room more often .
thanks dad , that ' s great advice .
what do you think ?
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
the nineties ? never heard of it .
so what if i am ?
i ' m still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe .
and play !
don ' t want to be seen with you when you ' re hitting bottom .
there ' s this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me .

i ' ll have one drink , one cocktail and one booze , please .
well , actually , dad . . . i believe you .

i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
well , i wish homer was here .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
you make me sick homer . you ' re the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .

i ' m under thirty .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
dad , the plan !

forget it , ed . do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big ? why , the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head .
y ' know , it ' s really not fair you ' re charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !
yes they were ! but now they won ' t be ! because i don ' t have a mini-bike !
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
you have a drinking problem ?

they ' re all about smugglers .
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .

hitler mash-ups .
ah well , maybe just one more hour .
wow , you can do anything out here .
why did you make it do that ?
well . . . i really think you should watch your temper .
looks like i ' ve got the house to myself for a while .

uh oh .
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude .
they took the bait . let ' s go .
i liked it when it was me , mom and homer . you wrecked everything . i ' m leaving . goodbye .

aw , man ! we just missed it .
cowabunga , dude !

whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .
fresh out .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
amen , brother .
dad , the mailman is here .
what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
c ' mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you can ' t stay mad at me the whole time .
i understand why . you were wasted .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
i ' m bart .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
i ' m betting it ' s hunger and rage .
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
hey , look , another spaceship !
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
not so tough now , huh ?
mount kilimanjaro ?
oh , it will not .
i can help you .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
you ' re on , rope-a-dope !
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
rich kids don ' t need school ! when i grow up , you can buy an apartment building and make me the super .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
thanks , dad .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .
homer !
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .
i didn ' t take it .
what do you need a babysitter for ? i ' m almost ten and a half .
i understand why . you were wasted .
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i wouldn ' t be so screwed up .
what if she doesn ' t ?
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
what do you think ?
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
so what if i am ?

where are you going ?
i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
all righty !
can i stay with you , dad ?

dad . . . i don ' t know how to say this , but i don ' t want to drive your car . it ' s slow , it ' s ugly , it handles like a shopping cart . . .
you should call that radio station and let ' em have it .
i ' m old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .
hey , hey , hey . let ' s not get crazy . if you quit , i ' m telling mom everything .
i ' m gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet !

hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
milhouse abandoned me .

the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
tons .

well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i ' ve got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .
i ' m gonna make your life a living hell .
right , dad .
no reason . brother .
you could be my father figure .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
hitchhike -- it ' s faster !
okay .
hey , somebody screwed up bad ! you ' ve got all these big comics lined up for your show , but there ' s no krusty .
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
i ' m way ahead of ya , dad .
right , dad .
no need , dad . over the years i ' ve learned to find father figures wherever i can . . . construction workers , the internet . . . and nelson , here .
i feel so ripped off by that crappy movie , i ' m gonna chip a big hole in the floor .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
oh , man .
dad , the plan !
wow . he doesn ' t want to be my dad . he just wants to be a kid like me . almost makes me not wanna prank him . almost .
hurry , homer !
what ' s the big idea ? you covered up my paper .
nice try , homer .
we are home .
bart simpson , at your service .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
do you want me to watch and learn ?
then what was in the coffin ?
you ' re the boss .

i can ' t get in trouble at school . they put me in the remedial class ! i ' m surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round !
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
and so . . . the fat man caves . if you need me , i ' ll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .
no , dad . this whole thing was my fault . you run along .
dad !
i can help you .
don ' t give up , dad .
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
final score : bart , forty-one . homer . . . let ' s see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six . . .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
yes , sir .
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy ' s dream : a fat , suggestible zombie dad .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
you ' re the boss .
i ' ll say , dad . you must really love us to sink so low .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
mom , is that true ?
you ' re sneakin ' out to fight that bear . i wanna go too .
it ' s like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !
how do you know ?
ay carumba !

don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
you know , dad , it doesn ' t matter that we didn ' t see the alien . i ' ve really had a great time out here .
i already knew that , dad . i ' m gonna blame you .
sounds good . wanna eat my fat ?
yeah , but at least it was short .
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
hey , i call first bedsies !
you mean like we just did ?
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
lisa ' s going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we ' re gonna find out what lisa ' s up to , i ' ll need the help of all her old boyfriends .
tell it , daddy !
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
hey !
amen .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
also , i can ' t sleep at night ' cause there ' s this new bully who follows me home and . . .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
well . . .
foxy boxing ?
yeah . you did ! you told me when something ' s bothering you , and you ' re too damn stupid to know what to do , just keep your fool mouth shut . at least that way you won ' t make things worse .
okay .
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .
how ' bout the disney minority program ?
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !
listen . . . i was thinking . . . if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher . . . and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
don ' t worry . you ' ll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover , homina . . .

dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
uh-huh . bet he used bait , too .
cool man ! a media circus .
i dunno , dad . don ' t you have a better picture ?
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself .
chapter-book crowd ? that ' s a juicy peach , but what ' s the cream ?
you ' re the man , homer .
oh , this is perfect .
dad , that is genius , but i need some advice--
after dinner , can i watch cartoons ?
anything ' s better than that dump we came from .
there ' s no way that means anything other than i get a mini-bike . to the library !
yeah , this tether has some pluses .
no , dad , he ' s my friend !
yay !
oh , this is terrible . now who do we give the money to ?

and no matter what happens , i ' ll never forget the advice you gave me .
are you still talking about the earth ?
so you and mom aren ' t married ? does that mean i ' m a bastard ?

isn ' t karma where if you do something bad , bad things happen to you ?
sorry , dad . i can ' t just magically cure a broken leg .
yeah , man .
well , it used to be .
come on , dad . with his brains and your musky smell , i ' ve got a full male role model .
homer !

so what ' s our first job , huh ? test the roller coaster ?
all that ' s left is banana runts ! that ' s the worst runt !
um , hey , dad , i , i think he wants a . . .

dad , i want to be a daredevil .
we said " meh . "
uh , he didn ' t say science . . . he said " pie pants . "

just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger .
so , i suppose that ' s a hillbilly jacuzzi ?
why didn ' t you wait for me ?
we ' ll see .
what the hell are you talkin ' about ? you ' re the one who double dared us .
pathetic . a kid who can ' t keep his parents ' marriage together is no kid at all .
i ' ve got a partner .

you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
i love you , dad .
no ! stop the hovering !
do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass ?
seriously dad , i ' m worried . you should go on a diet .
wild , bushy hair , like an animal .
please , fbi man , don ' t throw us in jail . we just made one mistake .
eh , i got standards . i don ' t hand out high-fives like chiclets .
yeah , they ' re cool and they last the rest of the your life .
look , he thinks he ' s people .
i think it ' s the bright blue pants . i mean , you ' re not on a golf course .
all right , the personals ! hmm . hm-hm-hm . " successful mayor-type seeks open-minded , discreet cheerleader-type . "
dad , you ' re a hero !
his house ?
you ' re the man , homer .
homer , i ' ll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .
what is the mind ? is it just a system of impulses , or is it something tangible ?
i ' m bart simpson . who the hell are you ?
unky herb , what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself ?
can ' t live this way . . . anymore .
why don ' t you encourage him to get us some health insurance ?
gay out ?
lisa , lisa ! i think you ' re right about dad . something ' s very , very wrong here .
no .
yeah , so we ' ve already heard stories from thousands of years ago , about stuff that didn ' t happen .
well , i ' d like to trust you , homer . but you ' ve been in jail three times .
cowabunga one to fat load .
building a soap box derby racer .
nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
can i burn evidence in it ?
quiet , dad , or we ' ll have to throw you outta here .
this isn ' t real money . it ' s printed by the montana militia .
permit me to demonstrate . lisa , shut your eyes . soon you will be at peace .
yeah , thanks a lot , flanders .
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
how much ?
dad ? it says " non-toxic . "
i like the beat -- play me the tune .
not to mention hilarious .
all right , homer , come on , baby . right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind .
you know what , dad ? maybe we ' ll go exploring on our own for a while .
the only person who thinks you ' re a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .
you better stick your head in and see what ' s going on .
dad , i ' ve got some bad news .
i ' m doing the conan o ' brien show and i wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about .
well , it all started last week in krabappel ' s class . . .
trick-or-treat ! lick my feet ! your head smells like pig-butt meat !
you ' re dead , squealer .
wait . only that ship is going to mars . our ' s is headed for the sun .
can i , for true ?
whooo ! whooo ! dad , do you know anything else about women ?
you know what would ' ve really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .
hey , homer , you promised mom you wouldn ' t wear your dress outside .
nope . . . nope . . . nope . . .
aye carumba !
so , i suppose that ' s a hillbilly jacuzzi ?
well , your father was a loser . and his father . and his father . it ' s genetic , man .
you ' re dead , squealer .
i see . so if my old bike didn ' t work , i would automatically get a new one ?
dad , do you realize we ' ve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined ?
if you really wanted us to be neater , you ' d serve us out of one long bowl .
dad , no !
i don ' t want a new dog . i want santa ' s little helper .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
i didn ' t do it . nobody saw me do it . there ' s no way they can prove anything .
huh -- garbage angels ?
who cares ? if you kill him , we ' ll be on tv !
you throw like my sister , man !
ashes to ashes . . . dust to dust . . . we ' ve gotta go fight some robots .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
ay carumba !
didn ' t seem like anybody even read the script .
what ' s this notice on the wall ?
now get cracking on my long division . and don ' t forget to show your work , simpson .
who knows ? but it sure is easy . i ' ll walk you through it . all you have to do is--
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
lis , your stupid present will only last a week . mine will sit in a closet for years .
what ? why ?
hey , man , i didn ' t do anything wrong .
nelson took my lunch money again !

oh , dad . you ' re the best father a boy could ever have !
bo-ring . i ' ll take you to a place that ' s really romantic .

mrs . krabappel , i ' m done failing the test . can i please go to the nurse ?
i don ' t know , dad . what if she ' s still mad at me ?
wow , you ' re right , dad . it is windy .
well , then we ' re gonna leave you one digit short .
i ' unno . i kinda want a cigarette .
is that true ?
dad , the car !

dad , we weren ' t playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking .
gee , homer . looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands .
ah well , maybe just one more hour .
why did you make it do that ?
if you really wanted us to be neater , you ' d serve us out of one long bowl .
it ' s eight in the morning !
wow ! can i see your club ?
yeah . there ' s just no way to resist it , is there ?
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
this town can ' t teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .
uh , dad , lisa ' s the one you ' re not talking to .
and the lord said , " let there be crap . "
come on , dad , just twelve more pounds .
where do you want it , the mouth or the eyes ?
i ' m not a nerd -- i ' m a jock who ' s too cool for sports .

trying to fix your broken brain .

any thoughts on how we ' re gonna get there ?
after dinner , can i watch cartoons ?
dad , i ' m asking if i can get a job .

one stinkin ' letter ? why ' d you make us gather ' round like that ?

wow ! did you actually get to see the rod ?

it ' s the first day of school .
uh , dad ?

makes sense to me .
and play !
mom , is that true ?
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
your electric hammer , maestro ?
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
yeah , not to mention lookin ' like a pig , eatin ' like a pig . . .
yes , sir !
you don ' t have a clue , do you , dad ?
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
after breakfast me and milhouse are goin ' down to the ravine . we got a tip from a six year old that there ' s a dead martian down there .
hey big man / don ' t want no trouble / i ' m just here to do the super bowl . . . shuffle . . .
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
where are you really going ?
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
fresh out .
. . . dad .
can i ask you something , dad ?
amen .
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
right , dad .
dad , how drunk are you ?
i suppose .
we ' re still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
technically , it ' s for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .
where are you going ?
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
dad , i can ' t let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .
fine with me . look , i packed you a bag .
i ' m under thirty .
what about my birthday party ?
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
but we didn ' t enter any police raffle .
right .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
yeah .
okay . i ' ll take some white meat and stuffing to go . . . and , send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes .
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
but rod picked his dad . it ' s a matter of family honor .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
what an odd thing to say .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
but dad . . .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
agreed .
wake up dad / you ' re singing a song !
you mean i can go ?
sure , why not ?
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
. . . dad .
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
amen , brother .
it ' s goose !
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
dad , otto ' s going through a real tough time . can ' t he stay with us for awhile ?
uh . . . nobody . wrong number .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
look , here ' s the box for my pitchback . if i still had it , i could put it in here .
it ' s probably a million years old , dad . i think it ' s as valuable as it ' s gonna get .
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you ?
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
you ' re welcome . and from now on , dad , if anyone laughs at you , they ' ve gotta go through me .
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !
hey , man , don ' t bad-mouth the head .
but you think there ' s like a kernel of good inside me , right ?
i think you ' re startin ' to crack .
i ' ve been bustin ' my hump all week for that withered old clam , and all i got was fifty cents .
why don ' t you buy it ?
then can i get a tattoo that says , " bite me ? " you never know when it might come in handy .
hey , dad . here ' s one . twenty-eight dollars an hour , plenty of fresh air . . . and you get to meet lots of interesting people .
no reason . brother .
sure , why not ?
an elephant ' s butt ?
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
who needs you ? tom ' s a better father than you ever were .
zuh ? wait , that ' s it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
no problem . i ' ll just sit here , closer to mom ' s ear . mom , how do you think we really got that panini press ?
again ! again !
what ?
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
me too . and you know what ? i ' m afraid you might . . . change back .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
okay , i promise .
you weren ' t lisa ' s hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .
thanks , dad .
so it ' s a prank you ' re lookin ' for , is it ? i ' ll give you your prank . . .
thanks , dad .
milhouse abandoned me .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
don ' t drag me down with you , old man .
you spent all the money i earned ? !
well , sure you do .
did you check your pocket ?
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
busted !
no way ! you can ' t give my dog away ! i ' ll set fire to my hair ! i ' ll rip up all my clothes ! i ' ll put sugar in the gas tank !
i ' m just mad all the time .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
look at this ! special insert -- " iron-on mad-ness ! " " ban the bath , " " don ' t trust anyone over ten , " " sock it to me " . . .
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .
hello , i ' m dr . hibbert . i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to amputate your butt .
we ' re out of waffles .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
i ' ve kissed three girls .
we ' re simpsons , dad . we don ' t do good behavior .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
. . . and for every syringe i find , i get a dollar .
put it in the bank .
there ' s got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he ' ll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .
what about abraham lincoln ?
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
hey , that ' s my pop up there ! dad watch out !
paw !
smooth move , mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn ' t serve beer .
i thought you wanted me to drum !
yeah !
amen .
you have a drinking problem ?
i ' m just mad all the time .
did you check your pocket ?
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
dad , you barely go to work at all .
no , you were right , it ' s " false . " wow , you really are gonna be a monorail conductor !
i got some old magazines to burn . " popular science , " " redbook " , " big and tall halloween costume " catalogue . . .
oh , come on , i do plenty around here ! lisa never lifts a finger . why don ' t you go yell at her ?
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
should i get my helmet ?
i don ' t think any of us expected him to say that .
oh man , i would love to pirate that .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
can i stay with you , dad ?
i ' m sure he meant to say " serious drinking . "
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
good night , dad . you know , these last few days have been really swell . i wish there was something i could do to repay you .
foxy boxing ?
i never thought i ' d say this , but i missed you guys . even what ' s her name , lisa .
we ' re out of waffles .
comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i didn ' t even touch ' em !
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
i understand why . you were wasted .
you could be my father figure .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
come on , homer . this isn ' t funny .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
what if someone catches him ?
dad , you don ' t understand . this was never about being cool . it was about you not caring how i felt .
hit the road , " welcome home . "
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
dad , you bought that , because it was full of gummy worms .
hey , dad . are we going camping ?
eh , we could try it .
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .
well , you told her , dad .
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
i can ' t believe it only comes fifty-two times a year .
agreed .
hey , dad , i ' ve been thinking . what if instead of giving up on grease , we go for one last big score ?
it ' s weird to hear myself saying this , but . . . i love you guys . this is gonna be the best vacation ever !
what are you talking about ?
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son ' s little league team ?
look , dad . i don ' t need school . i ' ll make my way as a bootblack . shine yer boots guv ' nor ?
tune in tomorrow , and every day until the curfew is lifted . because we ' ll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield ' s other adults .
mount kilimanjaro ?
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
look man , you ' ve got to enjoy yourself a little . you work hard , or at least you ' re out of the house a lot .
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?
our book ! the real one !
dad , it-it ' s me !
oh , yeah .
this robot ' s the greatest thing you ' ve ever done for me . i can ' t believe you ' ve never seen him fight .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
anything slim !
i miss you , dad . mom won ' t let me read " hagar the horrible . "
but then they ' ll just beat me up even worse .
" to me bestest bud milhouse , happy birthday , bart . "
your electric hammer , maestro ?
oh , lemme go with you , dad !
i suppose .
i think i ' ve come up with the answer .
amen .
no , but here ' s a book called " chicken soup for the loser " that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats .
i ' m thinking of something big . so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back !
no reason . brother .
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .
i don ' t know about this , dad . shouldn ' t we give the money to charity or some . . . ? ow !
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
let ' s just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it ' s nice for the next people .
check it out , dad . i rented all your favorite gorilla movies . " gorilla squadron , " " gorilla island vi , " . . .
duncan ' s really fast , dad . he was just intimidated by those other horses .
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
hey , if they got a picture of you , that means they can see you . they ' re probably watching us right now .
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
no , i ' m not . i suck .
tonight we ' re gonna put our fake sores back on , then jump the fence at club med , and scare the normals .
huh ? wait a minute , this doesn ' t look like oslo . where are the wood-stave churches ? historic akershus fortress ?
i kinda think it ' s cool . just pretend you ' re in a zombie movie . besides , this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc .
before you kill me , remember , this trip is " all expenses paid . "
um hm .
did you check your pocket ?
this whole thing is silly . i mean , isn ' t the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?
the fat guy on tv ?
if you get one up his butt , it ' s a million points .
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
what a dump !
you mean grampa ' s old farm ?
well , that ' s what we learned about . i sure as hell can ' t tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell , can i ?
yes , sir .
those aren ' t the dog ' s eyes , are they ?
well , i wish homer was here .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
he said what now ?
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
no dad , you fell asleep in front of the tv watching " the towering inferno . "
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
the krusty show sucks now . it ' s all pink and princessy . why are great things always ruined by women ? the army . . . the fantastic four . . . think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy !
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
agreed .
well , don ' t buy ' em !
you ' d think a house full of crazy people would be fun . it ' s actually really depressing .
don ' t worry . this is the score we ' ve been dreamin ' about . the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied .
bart simpson , at your service .
what if someone catches him ?
the nineties ? never heard of it .
the nineties ? never heard of it .
i ' ll show lisa who ' s dumb . " supreme court reverses . . . " i won ' t turn to the comics , i won ' t turn to the comics .
i ' m goin ' for a corn dog . you want one ?
well , dad , in the meantime , here ' s a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff .
yeah , that ' ll be way more fun than vegas .
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .
bart simpson , at your service .
what happened to you , man ? you used to be cool .
and for the college-bound . . . 000 stay-alert capsules .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
these games are so old . who got these high scores ? pilgrims ? hmm , never saw this one before .

sorry , dad . maybe now you ' ll appreciate us . . .
hey ! you nearly hit me on the head !
okay .
hey , you guys want a lift in my pedal boat ?
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .
well , i know it wouldn ' t hurt ' em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years .
life is good .
yee-hawww !
um , look dad , i got something to tell you .
i got suspended from school today .
not bloody likely .

maybe i can make some money , dad . my magic act is really coming along .

you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he ' s really awesome !
dad !
dad , no !
no , dad , they ' re the opposite .
so ?
lisa , do you really need all these kurt vonnegut novels ?
why didn ' t you wait for me ?
come on , dad . didn ' t you ever do anything wild when you were a kid ?
you threw it , you go find it .
it ' s an insult . sock him , dad . sock everybody .
dad , i ' m asking if i can get a job .
hey , homer , bring me back a torpedo .
i feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap .
that ' s not you . they just painted shrek yellow .
you can ' t escape , bob ! if the tennis rackets don ' t get you , the pool skimmers will .
now , let ' s put it on a shelf and never look at it again .
i ' m not afraid , i ' m not afraid , i ' m not . . .

bob , your family will find out the truth . sooner or later you ' ll try to kill me again . watch , i ' ll prove it .
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .
i guess it ' s possible .
dude , take it easy on the fatty foods . you ' re running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart .
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
slurp my snot .
all right , homer . whoa , you really are a sport , dad , taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger !
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .
ah come on dad , if you really want to help , you can clean these paint brushes .
no , skinner said i had a clean slate . so right now , i ' m as good as any other kid .
let ' s never miss the school bus again .
um , that ' s awesome . but i think i ' ll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me .
hey dad , will you help me build this model rocket ?
cheeky .
i want to watch krusty .
oh , man .
yeah ! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life , even though you ' re the sole provider for a family of five ! i am the luckiest kid in the world .
dad , it ' s all my fault ! i shook up that can of beer !
mom . get him away from the window .
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
but i don ' t hate this country .
homer , first of all it ' s " par-tay . " and second , we wouldn ' t par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .
now fly -- to the canary islands !
way to go dad . hey , where ' s the food ?
oh . that ' s great . i wouldn ' t trade it for all the tea in china ? !
hey , dad . my band finally got a break . i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock . how about a little loanski ?
dad , wait ! you haven ' t heard my story .
country cousins ? are they rubes ? ' cause i don ' t cotton to rubes .
goose gladwell ripped me off and there ' s nothin ' i can do about it . i ' m just a stupid kid .
a girl at school won ' t go to the dance with me .
i was thinking more of the deep fryer .
we ' re on food stamps ?
dad , i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will .
well , you ' re not really a trucker now .
i ' ll be gus , the lovable chimney sweep . clean as a whistle , sharp as a thistle , best in all westminster . yeah !
you ' re goin ' down , homer ! i ' m gonna fool you !
now !
dad , can i talk to you about something ?
oh , okay .
we had a story to go with this painting , but it was far too intense . so we just threw something together with vampires . enjoy !
huh ?
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
that ' s no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great .
he ' s not a regular bum , mom . he ' s a genius bum . he created itchy . and he ' s the father of cartoon violence .
i just don ' t want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .
well , yeah , but --
you think so ?
ah , cool , man . space mutants 0 . drop me off ! drop me off !
bad news , dad , we ' re out of food . we ' re even out of the basic elements of food . you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce .
no , i ' m not . i suck .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
tell it , daddy !
yeah , now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt , we ' ll be on easy street .
how ' d you get the eyes to move ?
dad , it ' s getting cold out here .
you don ' t get it , do you ? i don ' t want to be your stupid quarterback ! i quit !
uh , i don ' t think lenny ' s house has a steeple .
do shut up ?
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you ' d throw me a party .
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
what a dump !
dad . . . i gotta tell you something . . . hope you won ' t be too mad . . .
busted !
dad , i ' m kinda edgy right now . i ' d appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife .
testify !
dad , i love you , but you taught me to win .
hey , wait a minute . i don ' t have to give blood . i have rights , you know .
aw , come on .
um , i took him to a kennel . . . two towns over . just ' til the new dog gets settled .
dad , if there ' s a really special girl and she likes some clod who ' s beneath her , what should you do ?
so , you fought all those robots ?
mmm . don ' t worry , dad . i ' m saving one for you .
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
i suppose .
no ! this family stinks . mr . burns nurtures my destructive side . i ' m suffocating here .
no .
it ' s a deal .
maybe when i ' ve got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face , it sets , i don ' t know , a low bar ?
nah , it ' s not so bad . here we can spit on the floor .
go for it .
it ' s back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !
where are you going ?
you ' re absolutely right , homer . we don ' t need a baby-sitter .
paw !
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
and , thank you , god , for the bad things adults do , which distract attention from stuff i ' m doing . amen .
hey dad , there ' s an arcade across the street . . . and there ' s really no point in all of us waiting in line . . .
what are you talking about , homer ? where are we going ?
no me gusto . que lastima .
are you kidding ? you ' re the worst dad who ever lived ! i ' d rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you !
i ' m sorry , i know it ' s wrong . i messed everything up and now i don ' t have any dogs at all .
i ' m so proud of you , poppa .
mo-om ! dad ' s imagining me as food again !
i ' m just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?
well . . .
yes , sir .
. . . dad .
well , dad , since you are taking an interest in us , maybe i should tell you . . .
who ' s in there ?
oh yeah ? remember this ? " higher , dad , higher ! . . . whee , whee . . . push harder , dad ! . . . "
toot-toot ! look ! i ' m using this rock as a tool !
don ' t worry , dad , as three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck says , " gravity is my co-pilot . "
uh , i think that ' s in italy , dad .
right , dad .
ah sure , there ' ll be a couple of uptight counselors who won ' t dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .
they were gonna go to the folk art museum , then they were gonna paint crab shells . not crush them , paint them .
huh ?
wait . wait . wait . bob can ' t stay with us . this man has tried to kill me so much it ' s not funny anymore .
