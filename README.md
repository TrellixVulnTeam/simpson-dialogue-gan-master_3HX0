# Methods
1. Using Seq2Seq with attention and discriminator with policy gradient to build a Simpson chatbot.   
2. The architecture model is refer to Adversarial Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06547.pdf).  
3. I changed the input to the data of the Simpson dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/pierremegret/dialogue-lines-of-the-simpsons), and only select the content of the conversation between Bart and Homer, which Homer is Query and Bart is Answer.
